Participants in the Environmental Studies Concentration explore the knowledge, skills, and worldviews that address many of society’s most pressing environmental issues. From forestry management to environmental art, coral reef investigation, and the mental health benefits of wilderness exploration, our Environmental Studies Concentration culminating capstones are chosen from a wide range of subject areas.\nStudent Examples:\nLobstering | Water Conservation | Climate Change\nStudent Reflection:\n\"I have not always been interested in Environmental Science. It was not until my sophomore year when I took AP Environmental Science that my perspective changed. I believe global warming is a big deal and I am passionate about learning more routes that individuals can take in order to help decrease their environmental footprint. I hope to use my capstone as an opportunity to learn more about water conservation and be able to apply that in my everyday life all while positively impacting the Proctor community.\" - Nate ‘20\nGlobal Citizenship | Est. 2016\nThe Global Citizenship Concentration allows students intrigued by global issues, world languages, and cultural exploration to investigate beyond the traditional bounds of a single class or course of study and generate a unique academic and world view. \nThe Global Citizenship Concentration allows students intrigued by global issues, world languages, and cultural exploration to investigate beyond the traditional bounds of a single class or course of study and generate a unique academic and world view. The Global Citizenship Concentration incorporates diverse coursework, possibilities for multiple off-campus experiences, community involvement, and the planning and execution of a capstone that ties these aspects together to illustrate the genuine interests of the student. \nStudent Examples:\nNative American History in Middle Schools | The United States' and the United Fruit Company's Legacy in Latin America | Bottled Water’s Legacy and Embodiment of a Disposable Culture | Saigon: The New Colonialism\nStudent Reflection:\n“During my revisit day in the spring of my freshman year, I was able to speak to Tom Morgan about the wonderful capstone project opportunities here at Proctor, and I was hooked. I have always had a knack for history and international politics, so it was only fitting that I pursue the Global Citizenship capstone project. As I dive headfirst into the research process, I am looking forward to discovering new pieces of information that I have never learned about before. I am driven by the thought of expanding my knowledge and discovering new areas of study, and my capstone project is a great way for me to achieve these goals.” - Ryan '20 \nCreative Studies | Est. 2018\nWith an emphasis on creative arts, a Creative Studies concentration provides the venue for students to illustrate self-expression and the artistic process throughout their coursework, extracurricular, and community service activities. \nCreativity lies at the heart of all human development and innovation. Proctor’s Creative Studies Concentration accommodates a wide range of interests, encouraging creative voice across disciplines including arts, sciences, humanities, and technology. With an emphasis on creative arts, this is the perfect concentration for students to illustrate self-expression and the artistic process throughout their coursework, extracurricular, and community service activities. Through the capstone, Creative Studies students showcase their individual perspectives on their chosen issue through any combination of mediums: visual, industrial, performing, media & literary arts.\nStudent Examples:\nLand Art & the Creative Sublime |Cultural Fluency in a World of Walls\nStudent Reflection:\n“I was initially inspired by my advisor, Shauna Turnbull, to complete a capstone project my senior year—she frequently encourages my participation in extracurriculars that are in-line with artistic interests of mine. I am quite looking forward to this outdoor art-creating process! I am grateful for having this incentive to get out in the woodlands and to learn to let go as nature takes its course.” - Ingrid ‘20\nSocial Justice | Est. 2019\nIn the Social Justice Concentration students develop an acute understanding of the forces and causes which form the roots of social problems as well as their sense of humility and compassion.\nStudents invested in social justice, human rights, multiculturalism, or issues such as social inequality, discrimination, and perspectives of marginalized citizens gravitate toward Proctor’s Social Justice Concentration. This Concentration aims to engender a sense of humility and compassion as well as an acute understanding of the forces and sources which form the roots of social problems. Students graduating from Proctor’s Social Justice Concentration complete a minimum of 30 hours of community service, engage in social justice issues near their home or campus, and design and complete a capstone that communicates their findings to a broader audience. \nStudent Examples:\nDeath Row & the Wrongfully Convicted\nStudent Reflection:\n“I have always been interested in both law and human rights. Three years ago, I worked as an intern in the Vermont State House, where I witnessed a lot of behind the scenes policy work. This internship helped spark my interest in law and the possibility of pursuing it in college. Recently I watched Just Mercy with my family; this movie opened my eyes to the reality of injustice in our court system. I continued to do some research about Death Row and how victims could be wrongfully convicted of a crime. I am fascinated with this whole idea, which bridges my interests in both law and social justice.” - Ayla ‘21\nSTEM | Est. 2019\nStudents leverage Proctor’s technology lab, experiential programs, and broad offerings in science and math curriculum when they participate in the STEM concentration to put their spin on the Proctor experience.\nStudents leverage Proctor’s technology lab, experiential programs, and broad offerings in science and math curriculum when they participate in the STEM concentration to put their spin on the Proctor experience. STEM participants can explore hands-on opportunities in STEM-related occupations, take classes from a body of relevant coursework, participate in applied extracurricular activities, and complete and present a capstone with both hands-on and research components. The culminating capstone works presented by STEM students take the form of innovative engineering designs, neuroscience investigations, and biochemical.\nStudent Examples:\nComputer Assisted Design\nStudent Reflection:\n“Using Computer Assisted Design, Arduino, and a 3-D printer, I developed a drone to function via a remote controller. The foundation of my work and my passion for technology sprung from my participation in Engineering and Robotics at Proctor. It is exciting having the opportunity to pursue a STEM Concentration and create a unique capstone project beyond the technology classes I have already taken at Proctor.” - Camden '21",

ITS strives to make work easier, effective, and efficient, while ensuring that data is digitally accurate, secure, and that users are following the school’s Technology Use Contract.\nA leader in integrating technology seamlessly into the learning environment, Proctor was one of the first schools to deploy a campus-wide network and establish a full-time internet connection with the National Science Foundation in the mid-1990s. Proctor launched a 1-to-1 laptop program in 2000 and an iPad initiative in the fall of 2013, and continues to lead in the area of technology integration in the classroom today. This rich history of digital education allowed Proctor to transition to online learning quickly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and now that the school has returned to normal operations, classrooms continue to weave the lessons learned from the virtual model into Proctor’s highly relational, in-person educational model.\nWhat We Do:\nSupport Students and Employees\nRecommend, Support and maintain all Hardware\nRecommend, Support and maintain all Software\nEnsure the safe access to and reliability of data\nHelping You Get Connected\nAdobe Creative Cloud \nGoogle Workspace \nFOB Photo ID Cards \nWireless and Network Access \nPrinters and Papercut \nVPN \nYour myProctor Account \nAdobe Creative Cloud\nAll employees and students have access to Adobe Creative Cloud's web and desktop applications.

Watch for an email from helpdesk@proctoracademy.org with instructions on account access. Use of Google Drive is encouraged for important documents to prevent potential loss of data should a computer be lost or die unexpectedly.\nFOB Photo ID Cards\nThe Helpdesk takes photos for Proctor's FOB/photo id cards for students and employees. FOBs are used to access assigned dorms and buildings. Student access to the fitness room, girls locker room, and dorms are managed by ITS. The Dean of Residential Life manages dorm changes and notifies ITS, who updates card access. ITS will not change student dorm access without first receiving confirmation of the change. \nFor off-hour access to Slocumb or the Music Studio, a student must request access from either their Art or Music teacher.\nEmployee access is based on the position an employee holds. Safety, Security, and or ITS may grant or change access as appropriate.

  "text": "A Typical Dorm Room \nThe Roommate Pairing Process \nDorm Meetings and Dorm Culture \nDorm Leaders \nWeekends on Campus \nA Typical Dorm Room\nMost students live in doubles with a roommate, however, there are opportunities for single rooms as well as a few triples on campus. Each of Proctor’s 21 dormitories has a unique “feel” based on its size, age, and the dorm parents who call that dorm home. Each dorm room is equipped with a single bed, desk, and dresser, as well as a closet for hanging clothes.\nThe Roommate Pairing Process\nThrough the admission process, new students are paired with peers of similar interests while returning students choose their roommates. We know, however, living with another individual can bring with it occasional challenges. Our goal is to help roommates work through conflicts by undergoing mediation activities led by the dorm parent, dorm leader and Dean of Residential Life. Students learn to appreciate differences while applying Proctor’s core values of respect, responsibility, honesty and compassion in their dormitories.\nFollowing a student’s first year at Proctor, they may choose their roommate and enter into the annual housing lottery to select their dorm room. Read advice from boarding students on why living with a roommate is so fun HERE!\nDorm Meetings and Dorm Culture\nDorm parents work in conjunction with dorm leaders to plan weekly meetings. These gatherings in the dorm commons room provide opportunities for the dorm to gather and discuss community living, any challenges that have arisen within the house, or activities students are hoping to plan for their residence. A dormitory is more than a residence. It is your home away from home and establishing a healthy, supportive, loving, understanding environment to live and learn is central to Proctor’s Residential Life curriculum. \nDorm Leaders\nEach dormitory is assigned at least one student dorm leader for the year. Dorm Leaders promote open communication, mutual understanding, and the development of shared expectations among residents in order to support the mission and values of Proctor and its residential life program. Among other responsibilities, dorm leaders work with dorm parents and other dorm leaders to hold dorm meetings, manage student dorm jobs, plan events, and conduct student check-ins. Dorm leaders participate in meetings and trainings throughout the year that promote effective leadership skills and character development.\nWeekends on Campus\nEach weekend, Proctor’s Student Activities Office, with input from students, organizes both on and off-campus weekend events. Ranging from trips to local attractions, to apple picking, to shopping, to on-campus events like dodgeball, open mic nights, and open skates at the hockey rink, students have the opportunity to engage with their peers and faculty through fun activities each weekend.",

Each of Proctor’s 21 dormitories has a unique “feel” based on its size, age, and the dorm parents who call that dorm home. Each dorm room is equipped with a single bed, desk, and dresser, as well as a closet for hanging clothes.\n\n## [The Roommate Pairing Process](#fs-panel-3628)\n\nThrough the admission process, new students are paired with peers of similar interests while returning students choose their roommates. We know, however, living with another individual can bring with it occasional challenges. Our goal is to help roommates work through conflicts by undergoing mediation activities led by the dorm parent, dorm leader and Dean of Residential Life. Students learn to appreciate differences while applying Proctor’s core values of respect, responsibility, honesty and compassion in their dormitories.\n\nFollowing a student’s first year at Proctor, they may choose their roommate and enter into the annual housing lottery to select their dorm room. Read advice from boarding students on why living with a roommate is so fun [HERE](https://blogs.proctoracademy.org/living-with-a-roommate-and-lessons-from-dorm-leaders)!\n\n## [Dorm Meetings and Dorm Culture](#fs-panel-3630)\n\nDorm parents work in conjunction with dorm leaders to plan weekly meetings. These gatherings in the dorm commons room provide opportunities for the dorm to gather and discuss community living, any challenges that have arisen within the house, or activities students are hoping to plan for their residence. A dormitory is more than a residence. It is your home away from home and establishing a healthy, supportive, loving, understanding environment to live and learn is central to Proctor’s Residential Life curriculum. \n\n## [Dorm Leaders](#fs-panel-3632)\n\nEach dormitory is assigned at least one student dorm leader for the year.

  "text": "Leadership opportunities for students abound at Proctor. Formal leadership positions as School Leader, Assistant School Leader, class representatives, Day Student Leaders, Team Captains, and dormitory leaders are elected positions, however, each student has the opportunity to lead by forming a club or activity group around a personal interest, and given Proctor’s entrepreneurial nature, many students lead in this manner.\nStudent Leadership \nDorm Leaders \nClubs and Activities \nStudent Leadership\nStudent leadership serves as an elected student government for the student body. With representatives from each class led by an elected School Leader, Assistant School Leader and faculty advisor, this group of students works to plan activities and actively engages with the governance of the school.\nDorm Leaders\nEach dormitory has an elected dorm leader that promotes the health, wellness, and safety of students within that dormitory by becoming personally acquainted with each resident and creating an atmosphere of openness and approachability. Dorm leaders work alongside dorm parents to create a spirit of inclusion, unity, and respect among the dorm community, while supporting the mission and values of Proctor and its residential life program.\nClubs and Activities\nEach student has the opportunity to start and/or lead an extracurricular club. Many clubs started years ago by passionate students have become a part of the school’s fabric. Student initiated clubs in recent years have included an improvisational comedy, learning to DJ for dances, and intercultural awareness.\nLeading Through Service\nLeading through serving sits at the heart of the Proctor experience. Students choose to volunteer their time serving the Proctor and local community through a variety of ways, evolving each school year with student interests and passions. Here are a sampling of regular community service opportunities for students:\nAndover Elementary School Reading Program \nBiology Lab Volunteer \nCommunity Service Afternoon Activity \nDish Duty \nGreen Key Admission Tour Guides \nHorse and Barn Service \nLocal Food Pantry \nMath First Aid Tutoring Program \nSpecial Olympics Unified Sports \nSummer Service Trips \nTech Booth - Assembly and Performances \nTechnology Help Desk \nWoods Team \nAndover Elementary School Reading Program\nThis student-led community service opportunity pairs Proctor students with local elementary students at the Andover Elementary & Middle School. The program runs throughout the school year and provides a tremendous opportunity to connect with the local community while inspiring young minds.\nBiology Lab Volunteer\nProctor's biology room is a living classroom! All our critters who keep us company throughout the academic day need a little extra care in the afternoons and evenings. Students coordinate with the Science Department to feed and care for the reptiles who call Proctor's Shirley Hall home.\nCommunity Service Afternoon Activity\nDuring the Fall Term, a community service afternoon program is offered for interested students. The group tackles both on-campus and off-campus service projects, while interspersing a physical training program in Proctor's fitness center.\nDish Duty\nThe only mandated community service at Proctor comes in the form of Dish Duty. Each trimester, every advisory is assigned a dish duty day. On this day, students and their faculty advisor (usually groups of 5-7) wash dishes and clear tables in the dining hall for all three meals. The appreciation for hard work, food waste, and caring for community spaces are natural byproducts of this favorite service opportunity.\nGreen Key Admission Tour Guides\nProctor's Admissions Office gives more than 750 tours to visiting families each year. These tours are not possible without student tour guides. Proctor's Green Key program matches tour guides with guests each day, and is an incredibly fun and valuable way to serve Proctor. \nHorse and Barn Service\nEach spring, this faculty-sponsored group travels to a local horse barn to help with chores and squeeze in some much deserved riding as well. \nLocal Food Pantry\nThis faculty and student-led service opportunity affords a small group of students and faculty sponsor the opportunity to travel to nearby Franklin, NH to volunteer at a food pantry each month.\nMath First Aid Tutoring Program\nThis student-led math tutoring program takes place three times a week throughout the academic year. Students are able to volunteer their math expertise as they work with their peers to understand concepts and identify new study strategies to improve performance and comprehension in math classes. \nSpecial Olympics Unified Sports\nProctor has a long-standing partnership with Special Olympics New Hampshire that affords multiple opportunities for Proctor students to partake in unified sports with Special Olympians. Read more about this program HERE.\nSummer Service Trips\nThese two-week trips are a focused, rich opportunity for students in engage in cultural immersion and the principles of community building. Led by Proctor faculty members, groups range from 7-14 participants. Starting in 2012, Proctor built relationships with communities in Guatemala,Thailand, and South Dakota. Although not as long as the typical term-long Off-Campus Proctor programs, these dynamic trips offer students a vehicle to engage in experiential learning from a community service perspective. Trips are scheduled for June and July each year. Learn more about this summer's trip to Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota HERE!\nTech Booth - Assembly and Performances\nDuring each all-school assembly(Monday, Thursday, Friday), Proctor relies on a dedicated group of student volunteers to run the technical booth. This same group of students partners with members of Proctor's technology and theater departments to ensure sound, lights, and recordings work properly for all performances in the theater throughout the year. \nTechnology Help Desk\nEvery night of the academic year, Proctor's Technology Help Desk is open as a resource to trouble-shoot any and all technology issues. Students have the opportunity to volunteer their time and talent at the Help Desk as well.\nWoods Team\nProctor is fortunate to steward more than 2,500 acres of woodlands. The Woods Team cares for this expansive forest. Gathering after classes at the Woodlands Building, they hop in the back of a pickup truck for a bumpy ride over woodland trails to clear new trails, repair bridges, clean up logging sites and identify trees for selective cutting. They split logs for wood-burning furnaces in dormitories and the Johnson Family Sugar House. In March, their focus turns to tapping the school’s 300-plus maple trees, gathering sap and—best of all—boiling the sap into maple syrup in the sugarhouse. The Woods Team is a hearty crowd who love working outdoors on diverse tasks related to forestry and silviculture.",

Prescriptions may be mailed to the Health Center or filled at a local pharmacy. Prescriptions filled at this local pharmacy will be delivered on Monday - Friday to the Health Center. The Health Center encourages parents to keep a supply of their child's prescription medication at home for school vacations. During the school year, all prescription medications must be mailed to the attention of the Health Center and not your child. Parental permission is required for students under the age of 18 to transport his/her prescription medication home. For further clarification regarding the management of student medications, please refer to our medication policy.\nConfidentiality\nHealth Center personnel will maintain confidentiality of all health-related information within its care, except mandatory reporting or when the safety of a student or others is at risk. For example, Proctor teachers, advisors, coaches, and dorm parents will be made aware, on a need to know basis, of illnesses or injuries that affect a student's ability to safely participate in classes or other activities.\nDoctor's Appointments\nDr. Sarah Lester, M.D., Proctor’s Medical Director, will coordinate a visit to New London Pediatrics in New London, NH, if necessary. Dr. Lester's office will bill each student's insurance directly for these visits and any uncovered charges are billed directly home. Dr. Lester also sees students during weekly clinics for medication management and other medical issues held at the Health Center for which Proctor accounts are charged a $35 fee.\nWe strongly encourage students to complete routine health care while at home. However, orthodontic, dental, ophthalmological, physical therapy, and chiropractic services can be arranged locally upon request. School approved drivers transport students who require medical services off campus, and the charges for transportation are billed to the student account.\nHealth Insurance\nStudents are required to carry medical insurance. Parents should review their health insurance policies to ensure appropriate away from home coverage. Please note that out of state Medicaid is not valid in New Hampshire. Student insurance is available to both domestic and international students from an independent agency and may be purchased through the Health Center. Domestic boarding students will be provided a Major Accident insurance plan at no cost to the family. To ensure proper billing, a copy of the student's current health insurance card must be maintained in the Health Center.\nHospitals Nearby\nNew London Hospital, Franklin Regional Hospital, Concord Hospital, and Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center can be reached from campus within 20 minutes to one hour and provide excellent emergency and specialty services.\nInjuries While at School\nIn the case of a serious injury, all attempts are made to have a Proctor adult accompany the student to the hospital. If this is not feasible, a school approved driver will transport the student. If the student requires transportation by ambulance, a Proctor adult shall meet the student at the hospital as soon as possible and return the student to the Health Center, as needed, upon discharge, unless hospital admission is required.\nReporting Laws\nProctor’s Health Center follows New Hampshire mandatory reporting laws including, but not limited to, communicable diseases, child abuse or neglect, sexual abuse, and criminal acts that occur in a safe school zone.\nSex Education\nProctor Academy does not condone intimate sexual activity. However, we are aware that students will make their own decisions about sexual intimacy. Reproductive healthcare for students is accessible through the Health Center. The Health Center staff provides counseling and information about all options and choices regarding reproductive healthcare and prevention of sexually transmitted disease. Students are encouraged to discuss their choices with their parents. Referrals to medical offices or Family Planning clinics outside of Proctor Academy are made for those who seek services. Students may also access them independently. Condoms are available in the Health Center for prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.",

For example, Proctor teachers, advisors, coaches, and dorm parents will be made aware, on a need to know basis, of illnesses or injuries that affect a student's ability to safely participate in classes or other activities.\n\n## [Doctor's Appointments](#fs-panel-4036)\n\nDr. Sarah Lester, M.D., Proctor’s Medical Director, will coordinate a visit to New London Pediatrics in New London, NH, if necessary. Dr. Lester's office will bill each student's insurance directly for these visits and any uncovered charges are billed directly home. Dr. Lester also sees students during weekly clinics for medication management and other medical issues held at the Health Center for which Proctor accounts are charged a $35 fee.\n\nWe strongly encourage students to complete routine health care while at home. However, orthodontic, dental, ophthalmological, physical therapy, and chiropractic services can be arranged locally upon request. School approved drivers transport students who require medical services off campus, and the charges for transportation are billed to the student account.  \n \n\n## [Health Insurance](#fs-panel-4038)\n\nStudents are required to carry medical insurance. Parents should review their health insurance policies to ensure appropriate away from home coverage. Please note that out of state Medicaid is not valid in New Hampshire. Student insurance is available to both domestic and international students from an independent agency and may be purchased through the Health Center. Domestic boarding students will be provided a Major Accident insurance plan at no cost to the family. To ensure proper billing, a copy of the student's current health insurance card must be maintained in the Health Center.\n\n## [Hospitals Nearby](#fs-panel-4040)\n\nNew London Hospital, Franklin Regional Hospital, Concord Hospital, and Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center can be reached from campus within 20 minutes to one hour and provide excellent emergency and specialty services.\n\n## [Injuries While at School](#fs-panel-4042)\n\nIn the case of a serious injury, all attempts are made to have a Proctor adult accompany the student to the hospital. If this is not feasible, a school approved driver will transport the student. If the student requires transportation by ambulance, a Proctor adult shall meet the student at the hospital as soon as possible and return the student to the Health Center, as needed, upon discharge, unless hospital admission is required.\n\n## [Reporting Laws](#fs-panel-4044)\n\nProctor’s Health Center follows New Hampshire mandatory reporting laws including, but not limited to, communicable diseases, child abuse or neglect, sexual abuse, and criminal acts that occur in a safe school zone.\n\n## [Sex Education](#fs-panel-4046)\n\nProctor Academy does not condone intimate sexual activity. However, we are aware that students will make their own decisions about sexual intimacy. Reproductive healthcare for students is accessible through the Health Center. The Health Center staff provides counseling and information about all options and choices regarding reproductive healthcare and prevention of sexually transmitted disease. Students are encouraged to discuss their choices with their parents. Referrals to medical offices or Family Planning clinics outside of Proctor Academy are made for those who seek services. Students may also access them independently. Condoms are available in the Health Center for prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases."

  "text": "Over the past decade, Proctor has invested more than $20 million into its athletic and afternoon program infrastructure. Proctor’s breadth of programming is supported by a campus of 45 buildings, 20 dormitories, two synthetic turf fields, outdoor center with climbing wall, tennis courts, hockey rink, state of the art fitness center, and a privately owned and operated FIS ski hill. Explore some of our facilities below, and visit our Campus Map to learn more about all of Proctor’s facilities.\nFacilities\n2,500 Acres of Trails \nCarr/Emmons Field \nDance Studio \nElbow Pond \nFarrell Field Complex \nFarrell Fieldhouse \nLeonard Field \nMike Henriques and Betsy Paine Outdoor Center \nProctor Ski Area \nScott Pond Climbing Wall \nTeddy Maloney ‘88 Hockey Rink \nTennis Courts \n2,500 Acres of Trails\nInterwoven throughout Proctor’s 2,500 acres of woodlands and campus proper are miles upon miles of trails. The ever-growing trail network provides backyard mountain biking and trail running terrains for the Mountain Bike and Cross Country team, as well as a destination for local riders, runners, and hikers.\nView map of Proctor’s trail network. \nCarr/Emmons Field\nBordered by attractive white fencing—with Proctor Ski Area providing an impressive backdrop—Carr and Emmons Fields provide the largest natural grass fields in the region. The fields (Emmons is the west end) were graded in the 1990s, and are irrigated by the Blackwater River, which courses to the south. The facility provides three soccer fields during the fall athletic season. An all-new baseball field was installed at the south end in the fall of 2012, and lacrosse is played on the north field.\nDance Studio\nLocated in the Wilkins Meeting House, Proctor’s Dance Studio features both natural and artificial lighting, a genuine, suspended Marley floor, an integrated sound system and a mirror wall with a full ballet bar. Depending on the season, the studio is a busy place, as students study dance and rehearse for the school’s drama productions. \nElbow Pond\nLocated on the east side of Proctor’s 2,500-acre property, the Elbow Pond is accessible to students via several wilderness trails. The pond is fed both by cold springs and Mountain Brook, which cascades down the south side of Ragged Mountain. Cut by the Wisconsin Glacier, Elbow Pond is deep and narrow. The school maintains a boathouse, swim dock, rope swing and wood-fired sauna on the shoreline. The sauna gets plenty of use throughout the year, as “Polar Swimmers” warm themselves before jumping in (through the ice!) on chilly Friday mornings.\nFarrell Field Complex\nLocated in the heart of Proctor’s campus, the Farrell Field Complex features the region's finest synthetic turf playing fields and softball diamond. Farmland was excavated in 1957 to provide athletic fields for baseball, soccer, lacrosse and--eventually--field hockey. In the summer of 2012, the school completed the $1.9 installation of two synthetic playing fields, (one illuminated for night games and general recreation.) The 70,000 square-foot north field provides NCAA-sized surfaces for field hockey and boys' lacrosse. The lighted 93,100 square-foot east field hosts soccer, football, and girls' lacrosse. These fields are constructed for snow removal, enabling early spring season practice and play.\nFarrell Fieldhouse\nNamed for legendary teacher and former Head of School Lyle Farrell, Farrell Fieldhouse is the athletic center of Proctor and includes a brand new gymnasium, state of the art fitness center, locker rooms and athletic training center. Located on the west end of campus, the fieldhouse houses an immense “cage” and gymnasium, hardwood floor basketball courts, girls’ and boys’ locker rooms, athletic training facilities, athletic offices, a multipurpose turf training strip, and state of the art fitness center. Farrell Fieldhouse shares parking facilities with Teddy Maloney Rink.\nLeonard Field\nLeonard Field is a practice facility for Proctor football and lacrosse teams. Graded with the help of student labor in 1920, Leonard Field was Proctor’s first playing field. Located on the northeast corner of the central village on North Street, it was named for Hazel Clark Leonard, whose three sons attended the school. Over the decades, hundreds of great teams have practiced and played literally thousands of games here. In August, 2007, Leonard Field was resurfaced with new sod over a new layer of topsoil and sand for improved drainage.\nMike Henriques and Betsy Paine Outdoor Center \nUnlike any facility in the Lakes Region, the Mike Henriques and Betsy Paine Outdoor Center (affectionately known as the OC) was constructed in 2020 and is home to Proctor’s outdoor sports: mountain biking, skiing, snowboarding, cycling, kayaking, and Wilderness Orientation. Expansive workshops, state of the art waxing room, a climbing wall, conference room, and locker spaces for athletes, as well as a cavernous storage area on the second floor, provides the perfect launching point for Proctor’s athletes and coaches into the great outdoors. \nProctor Ski Area\nPut simply, from the start hut at the top of the mountain to the water systems that provide this great snow mass, to the snow surface and access to alpine, freestyle, Nordic, and jumping facilities, the Proctor Ski Area is New England’s finest privately owned and operated ski venue. The Proctor Ski Area is one of Proctor's greatest assets, serving Proctor’s downhill, Nordic, and ski jumping programs, as well as thousands of regional skiers. Learn more about the Proctor Ski Area's most recent enhancements that earned it Ski Magazine's Golden Eagle Award for Environmental Excellence HERE. \nScott Pond Climbing Wall\nLocated within the Mike Henriques and Betsy Paine Outdoor Center, the Scott Pond Climbing wall affords Proctor’s Rock Climbing team and Outing Club members (as well as any other interested students) the opportunity to climb indoors year round. The climbing wall is outfitted with five auto-belays and was installed in 2020. \nTeddy Maloney ‘88 Hockey Rink\n\"The Ted,\" as the rink is affectionately known, was built in 2002 and dedicated in memory of Teddy Maloney who graduated from Proctor in 1988, played goalie for the Hornets, and tragically died in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center.\nThe facility features a large (200’x 87’) skating surface, an indirect lighting system, state of the art refrigeration equipment and an oversized dehumidification system to provide an optimum ice making environment. Coupling this with the newest addition to the “Ted”, an Engo 200SX electric ice resurfacer, Proctor has become the best ice skating facility in New England.\nWhile Proctor's hockey program is the primary occupant of the facility, Kearsarge Youth Hockey, Colby Sawyer College and Kearsarge High School also consider the “Ted” their home. Proctor also hosts Granite State tournaments and the Dunlap Cup tournament as well has youth and prep level jamborees during the year. In 2012 Proctor cut the ribbon on our new locker room complex which provides a total of six new locker room spaces, coaches rooms, training room, officials room and lobby used during all three seasons of competition.\nTennis Courts\nSituated on a protected hillside immediately northwest of Farrell Fieldhouse are ten of the finest tennis courts in the Lakes Region. These new courts have the industry standard surface within tall cyclone fencing. The hill protects the courts from prevailing westerly winds, and the views to the south and east are breathtaking. A student-constructed equipment shed is configured to serve refreshments to players and spectators. Proctor's tennis courts are adjacent to the Sunapee-Ragged-Kearsarge Greenway, a “necklace” of hiking trails that extend 75 miles through the region.",

Proctor’s breadth of programming is supported by a campus of 45 buildings, 20 dormitories, two synthetic turf fields, outdoor center with climbing wall, tennis courts, hockey rink, state of the art fitness center, and a privately owned and operated FIS ski hill. Explore some of our facilities below, and visit our Campus Map to learn more about all of Proctor’s facilities.\n\n## Facilities\n\n*   [2,500 Acres of Trails](#fs-panel-2735)\n*   [Carr/Emmons Field](#fs-panel-2737)\n*   [Dance Studio](#fs-panel-2739)\n*   [Elbow Pond](#fs-panel-2741)\n*   [Farrell Field Complex](#fs-panel-2743)\n*   [Farrell Fieldhouse](#fs-panel-2745)\n*   [Leonard Field](#fs-panel-2747)\n*   [Mike Henriques and Betsy Paine Outdoor Center](#fs-panel-2749)\n*   [Proctor Ski Area](#fs-panel-2751)\n*   [Scott Pond Climbing Wall](#fs-panel-2753)\n*   [Teddy Maloney ‘88 Hockey Rink](#fs-panel-2755)\n*   [Tennis Courts](#fs-panel-2757)\n\n## [2,500 Acres of Trails](#fs-panel-2735)\n\n![trail](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1674757214/proctoracademyorg/mat4himxfljsgyxwnyeg/trail_1.jpg)\n\nInterwoven throughout Proctor’s 2,500 acres of woodlands and campus proper are miles upon miles of trails. The ever-growing trail network provides backyard mountain biking and trail running terrains for the Mountain Bike and Cross Country team, as well as a destination for local riders, runners, and hikers.\n\n[View map of Proctor’s trail network.](https://proctor.myschoolapp.com/ftpimages/3/download/download_1151091.pdf) \n\n## [Carr/Emmons Field](#fs-panel-2737)\n\n![Carr Field](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1674756764/proctoracademyorg/qmpnyfyvksfzgcjbbqts/carr.jpg)\n\nBordered by attractive white fencing—with Proctor Ski Area providing an impressive backdrop—Carr and Emmons Fields provide the largest natural grass fields in the region. The fields (Emmons is the west end) were graded in the 1990s, and are irrigated by the Blackwater River, which courses to the south. The facility provides three soccer fields during the fall athletic season. An all-new baseball field was installed at the south end in the fall of 2012, and lacrosse is played on the north field.\n\n## [Dance Studio](#fs-panel-2739)\n\n![Dance Studio](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1674758052/proctoracademyorg/pm6lfkr4hpe8nrptabr2/dance_studio.jpg)\n\nLocated in the Wilkins Meeting House, Proctor’s Dance Studio features both natural and artificial lighting, a genuine, suspended Marley floor, an integrated sound system and a mirror wall with a full ballet bar. Depending on the season, the studio is a busy place, as students study dance and rehearse for the school’s drama productions. \n\n## [Elbow Pond](#fs-panel-2741)\n\n![elbow pond](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1674761020/proctoracademyorg/ddjb21pkttqfo1y5wxsm/elbow_pond.jpg)\n\nLocated on the east side of Proctor’s 2,500-acre property, the Elbow Pond is accessible to students via several wilderness trails. The pond is fed both by cold springs and Mountain Brook, which cascades down the south side of Ragged Mountain. Cut by the Wisconsin Glacier, Elbow Pond is deep and narrow. The school maintains a boathouse, swim dock, rope swing and wood-fired sauna on the shoreline. The sauna gets plenty of use throughout the year, as “Polar Swimmers” warm themselves before jumping in (through the ice!) on chilly Friday mornings.\n\n## [Farrell Field Complex](#fs-panel-2743)\n\n![Farrell Field Complex](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1674761069/proctoracademyorg/vefywycbrwuxcgwfufak/farrell_fields.jpg)\n\nLocated in the heart of Proctor’s campus, the Farrell Field Complex features the region's finest synthetic turf playing fields and softball diamond. Farmland was excavated in 1957 to provide athletic fields for baseball, soccer, lacrosse and--eventually--field hockey. In the summer of 2012, the school completed the $1.9 installation of two synthetic playing fields, (one illuminated for night games and general recreation.) The 70,000 square-foot north field provides NCAA-sized surfaces for field hockey and boys' lacrosse. The lighted 93,100 square-foot east field hosts soccer, football, and girls' lacrosse. These fields are constructed for snow removal, enabling early spring season practice and play.\n\n## [Farrell Fieldhouse](#fs-panel-2745)\n\n![Field House](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1674761122/proctoracademyorg/lhfe6q5ntensppewfvxu/fieldhouse.jpg)\n\nNamed for legendary teacher and former Head of School Lyle Farrell, Farrell Fieldhouse is the athletic center of Proctor and includes a brand new gymnasium, state of the art fitness center, locker rooms and athletic training center. Located on the west end of campus, the fieldhouse houses an immense “cage” and gymnasium, hardwood floor basketball courts, girls’ and boys’ locker rooms, athletic training facilities, athletic offices, a multipurpose turf training strip, and state of the art fitness center. Farrell Fieldhouse shares parking facilities with Teddy Maloney Rink.\n\n## [Leonard Field](#fs-panel-2747)\n\n![Leonard Field](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1674761604/proctoracademyorg/qjyqovnjfoykgwf5rhrz/leonard_field2.jpg)\n\nLeonard Field is a practice facility for Proctor football and lacrosse teams. Graded with the help of student labor in 1920, Leonard Field was Proctor’s first playing field. Located on the northeast corner of the central village on North Street, it was named for Hazel Clark Leonard, whose three sons attended the school. Over the decades, hundreds of great teams have practiced and played literally thousands of games here. In August, 2007, Leonard Field was resurfaced with new sod over a new layer of topsoil and sand for improved drainage.\n\n## [Mike Henriques and Betsy Paine Outdoor Center](#fs-panel-2749)\n\n![Outdoor Center](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1674761210/proctoracademyorg/okmtqarpwsvuwbky3sfn/outdoor_center.jpg)\n\nUnlike any facility in the Lakes Region, the Mike Henriques and Betsy Paine Outdoor Center (affectionately known as the OC) was constructed in 2020 and is home to Proctor’s outdoor sports: mountain biking, skiing, snowboarding, cycling, kayaking, and Wilderness Orientation. Expansive workshops, state of the art waxing room, a climbing wall, conference room, and locker spaces for athletes, as well as a cavernous storage area on the second floor, provides the perfect launching point for Proctor’s athletes and coaches into the great outdoors. \n\n## [Proctor Ski Area](#fs-panel-2751)\n\n![Ski Area](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1674761314/proctoracademyorg/sj5liwoevunqwwydgd8h/skiarea.jpg)\n\nPut simply, from the start hut at the top of the mountain to the water systems that provide this great snow mass, to the snow surface and access to alpine, freestyle, Nordic, and jumping facilities, the Proctor Ski Area is New England’s finest privately owned and operated ski venue. The Proctor Ski Area is one of Proctor's greatest assets, serving Proctor’s downhill, Nordic, and ski jumping programs, as well as thousands of regional skiers. Learn more about the Proctor Ski Area's most recent enhancements that earned it Ski Magazine's Golden Eagle Award for Environmental Excellence HERE. \n\n## [Scott Pond Climbing Wall](#fs-panel-2753)\n\n![Climbing Wall](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1674761452/proctoracademyorg/mbenrtbx6tar7qpexdjx/climbing_wall.jpg)\n\nLocated within the Mike Henriques and Betsy Paine Outdoor Center, the Scott Pond Climbing wall affords Proctor’s Rock Climbing team and Outing Club members (as well as any other interested students) the opportunity to climb indoors year round. The climbing wall is outfitted with five auto-belays and was installed in 2020. \n\n## [Teddy Maloney ‘88 Hockey Rink](#fs-panel-2755)\n\n![Maloney Rink](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1674761813/proctoracademyorg/zp2gimuagv56hxgoccnt/maloney_rink.jpg)\n\n\"The Ted,\" as the rink is affectionately known, was built in 2002 and dedicated in memory of Teddy Maloney who graduated from Proctor in 1988, played goalie for the Hornets, and tragically died in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center.\n\nThe facility features a large (200’x 87’) skating surface, an indirect lighting system, state of the art refrigeration equipment and an oversized dehumidification system to provide an optimum ice making environment.  Coupling this with the newest addition to the “Ted”, an Engo 200SX electric ice resurfacer, Proctor has become the best ice skating facility in New England.\n\n  While Proctor's hockey program is the primary occupant of the facility, Kearsarge Youth Hockey, Colby Sawyer College and Kearsarge High School also consider the “Ted” their home. Proctor also hosts Granite State tournaments and the Dunlap Cup tournament as well has youth and prep level jamborees during the year. In 2012 Proctor cut the ribbon on our new locker room complex which provides a total of six new locker room spaces, coaches rooms, training room, officials room and lobby used during all three seasons of competition.\n\n## [Tennis Courts](#fs-panel-2757)\n\nSituated on a protected hillside immediately northwest of Farrell Fieldhouse are ten of the finest tennis courts in the Lakes Region. These new courts have the industry standard surface within tall cyclone fencing. The hill protects the courts from prevailing westerly winds, and the views to the south and east are breathtaking. A student-constructed equipment shed is configured to serve refreshments to players and spectators. Proctor's tennis courts are adjacent to the Sunapee-Ragged-Kearsarge Greenway, a “necklace” of hiking trails that extend 75 miles through the region."

  "text": "Aug 1 2023 4:13 PM \nA cool breeze and low humidity descended on Proctor’s campus today as we turned the calendar to August. Today is perhaps the most beautiful day of the summer to date. No wildfire smoke blowing down from Quebec. No oppressive humidity. No threat of torrential rain or flooding. The hints of fall in the air today are a far cry from the hottest, wettest summer that we have ever experienced. During this spectacular stretch of weather, we find ourselves spending every moment we can outdoors enjoying the glory of rural New Hampshire. \nIn 1891, then head of school Dr. Francis Morton (the old Morton House was his home he constructed on the outskirts of Proctor’s campus) built a trail network that extended into the largely deforested foothills of Ragged Mountain. Over the past 132 years, this original trail network has grown along with Proctor’s campus, now providing more than a dozen miles of integrated trails within Proctor’s 2,500 acres of woodlands. \nWe each utilize this land differently. By design and intentional multi-use management practices, the woodlands allow for hunters to harvest deer, bear, and other animals, for mountain bikers, runners, and hikers to exercise their bodies, and for our students to learn powerful lessons about their own intersection with the natural world through their classes. It is in each of these varied interactions that we find a constant: the ability to better focus and reflect on the chaos of our world when we are immersed in nature. \nRarely in life do we allow ourselves to exist in a moment of silence; a silence uninterrupted by traffic, our phone vibrating with a missed call or text message, or someone “needing” something from us. When we step into nature, we amplify our ability to listen, to truly hear that which is resonating in our own minds and hearts. When we make space for reflection, we find direction. \nLike so many lessons we learn from the natural world, perhaps this is our lesson for a summer filled with heat waves, tornados, and flooding: slow down and listen. We must not only listen to that which the global climate is screaming at us, but we need to better listen to each other and to ourselves. How can we carve out this quiet, intentional time with those we love so that we can hear, really hear, their story? How can we become better disciplined to embrace the slowness life can afford us when we allow it? How can we find ways to immerse ourselves in silence, a silence so many of us avoid because it terrifies us, and listen for direction and purpose? \nAs the start of the school year slowly approaches, may we find time to ask ourselves these questions and to let a little more silence into our lives. \nLearn More About Proctor's Woodlands!",

  "text": "Dec 18 2023 2:37 PM \nFrom snow to rain and cold, the Mountain Classroom group has been up to a flurry of eventful activities. Starting in the farmlands of Huntington, Vermont, the group stayed in a very pretty heated barn allowing us to settle into the frontcountry, and start our work with Penny Huett, our black ash basket instructor.\nThe hefty task of pounding black ash logs was the first step in our creation of the baskets themselves. Using mallets and knives we made the yearly growth rings peel up, stripping off the wood in perfect weaving strips that would be later used for our baskets. The long task of working with Penny Huett concluded after 3 days of work finishing our baskets.\nAfter a very successful trip to Burlington, and enjoying a nice town day and lecture from Professor Mariaka of UVM, the group started to familiarize ourselves with the backcountry gear for our trip on Camel’s Hump. The group made our way on the bus to Camel’s Hump, the second part of our trip. The first day was fully uphill making our way to Bamford Ridge Hut, the first campsite. Due to foundation issues, the shelter was closed and we made our way to the tent platforms and set up our campsite. Personally, my favorite part of the mini-term was the last day of Camel’s Hump where we had decided to explore instead of making a full push for the summit. We enjoyed thick snow, and a fun full day of walking around high up in the mountains. After making our way back to the campsite and enjoying a fire, we made our way down, and drove to Caleb’s childhood home in Ryegate, Vermont. \nThe group arrived at Caleb's farm, and were tired and burnt out from our three day expedition up Camel’s Hump. Upon our arrival we met Caleb’s sister’s cute Australian Shepherd Jiggit and moved into his unheated barn. Our first full day on the farm we went on a grocery run and prepared for our upcoming week, we also got a surprise pizza dinner from our instructors. On the 9th we did a day hike of Spruce Mountain where we had our first tree quiz. When we got back from our day hike we did our forty-five minute naturalist journal sit in the woods. This entailed all of us going out into the woods on our own and finding a spot to be alone. We took our journals and took notes about the nature surrounding us. Personally, I decided to observe a small deer field a quarter of a mile west of the barn. I decided to complete my naturalist journal during sunset. While I did not see any wildlife, it was a fabulous time to reflect, reset and have some peace and solitude after a long day of hiking. We had a delicious dinner that night of grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup cooked up by Zoie and Brooke.\nThe next few days were filled with rain and unfortunate weather. We were lucky enough to find shelter in Caleb’s warm childhood home to complete many classes and academic work. We drank tea and played with his friendly cat in the coziness of his home in between classes. Once the rain cleared, we were packing up to leave Caleb’s barn and head to our basket making instructor, Penny Huett’s, property. On the way to her property, where we would be staying in her lovely, heated barn, we stopped at Owl’s Head mountain for a quick, sunny, beautiful hike. On the way to the summit, we had another tree quiz. At the top of the summit, we learned from Caleb about compass declination. We had another tree quiz and then headed back down to the van. We made it safe and sound to Penny’s barn with the need of some pushing of the van by all of the students when it would not get through the snow. The next day we went on another great, longer hike up Pisgah mountain with lots of great views. Specifically, it overlooked Willoughby Lake which is the deepest lake in Vermont and was carved out by a glacier.\nThat evening, we were blessed by the arrival of Patty Pond and Annie Mackenzie. We had a delicious dinner all together, enjoyed some glacier history reenactment presentations and finished up the night with a nice evening meeting sharing appreciations of one another while sipping hot chocolate and laughing about some good times shared. The days ahead wrapping up what we have been calling “mini term” entails finishing all of our academic work due before our departure for break, packing up our belongings, cooking good meals for each other and finding fun along the way. On our last full day, some of us decided to build a quinzhee with Caleb. This resembles an igloo in the snow, except instead of blocks to build the foundation, it is packed snow and dug out inside.\nWe will have a very early wakeup tomorrow morning, and we will head back to home base, Andover, NH to then head home for a few weeks of break. It has been an exciting, challenging, and engaging past few weeks here in Vermont. We are all grateful for the lessons learned through the cold, and are eager for the second portion of winter term out West. \nCheck out more photos from Mountain Classroom on Flickr!",

Coming off the hottest, wettest summer in decades, those of us who have lived in Andover, New Hampshire for multiple decades feel the very real impacts of a shifting climate. Sometimes those impacts feel incremental, while at other times (like when we received no snowfall until late January last winter), they feel have a far greater impact on our day to day life. \nProctor’s Science Department Head and Environmental Coordinator Alan McIntyre’s work over the past fifteen years has led Proctor’s institutional commitment to environmental stewardship. Whether it is coordinating campus wide recycling efforts, engaging students in the study of solar potential on the rooftops of buildings (resulting in a massive investment in solar power by Proctor), engaging in the early stages of capital building projects to ensure they are aligned with the school’s environmental mission statement, Alan’s leadership has helped Proctor students, employees, and community members understand the economic and environmental pressures facing the school. \nIt is no surprise then, that Proctor and Alan received recognition last weekend at the 7th New York City Green School Conference for excellence in responsible relationship building around the environment. As Alan noted, “It takes individual action to get things done, but it also takes institutional will and policy to make things happen. Proctor received recognition for being a green school for putting our beliefs into action, something we must continue to do as we move forward as a community.” \nHosted by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network alongside the 78th Session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA 78) and the 2023 SDG Summit, the 7th NYC Green School Conference brought together thought leaders, educators, learners, policymakers, innovators, diplomats, administrators, solutions providers, bookkeepers, healthcare experts, and climate leaders worldwide to discuss a more inclusive, compassionate, and climate-conscious approach toward humanizing and climatizing global education. Alan joined hundreds of other educators and activists to hear keynote speeches and panel conversations from domain experts covering topics like the greening of learning spaces and school design, greening curriculum and integrating sustainability and environmental education into all disciplines, integrating sustainability principles into sports and activities, and extra curricular programs. \nReflecting on both Proctor’s recognition at the 7th NYC Green School Conference and his time soaking in all that the conference had to offer, Alan notes: \nI have been to many gatherings and conferences, but this opportunity was unique because the scope was truly global. The notion of “thinking globally and acting locally” was front and center. \nEach presenter linked their local work to specific sustainable development goals (there are 17 SDG from no poverty to affordable and clean energy). Many of these efforts were focused on familiar issues and concerns that we face here - waste management, energy conservation and connection with the outdoors. However mixed in was a clarion call to change our human systems, not just individual behavior. \nMaria Ivanova (Director of School of Public Policy & Urban Affairs, at Northeastern University) used the example of single-use plastics that plague countless meetings, conferences (not this one) and public gatherings as the example. Holding up her personal bamboo utensils, she tersely stated that her efforts were not enough. “Individual behavior can only do so much, the systems need to change in order to reach sustainable development goals,” real change will require “imagination, inspiration and impact.” \nMany other presenters took up that theme and gave examples of “imagination, inspiration, and impact” with hydroponic and garden projects (New York Sun Works), watershed tours (Hudson River Clearwater), indigenous storylines (Origins Education) and more. Regina Valdez of the Earth Institute quoted Rachel Carson, “It's not half so important to know as to feel,” and gave examples of environmental education efforts (Mission 4.7) that are transforming hearts and minds by building relationships with land and community. The sheer number of fresh, deliberate, and familiar efforts from across the planet was a welcome rallying cry for our campus efforts and vision for the future. The world is at work, and so is Proctor.\nLearn more about Proctor’s environmental stewardship efforts!",

  "text": "Oct 12 2023 9:33 AM \nEvery year at Proctor is wholly new, yet remarkably familiar. The faces of students change over time, both as they mature and as the natural turnover of the student body every four years introduces new, eager minds ready to embark on their Proctor experience. While Proctor is not a school steeped in tradition, there are some rituals that occur each year at the same time, including the annual ninth grade hike to the Proctor Cabin.\nOn the second Wednesday of October, as juniors partake in the PSATs, sophomores gather as a class, and seniors begin planning their Senior Projects, ninth graders gather outside the dining hall and hike with a dozen or so faculty members to the Proctor Cabin. At the core of this hike through foliage is the understanding that Proctor's culture is something each and every one of us must seek ownership of, regardless of age, time at the school, or perceived social clout. Our ninth graders play just as important a role in shaping our school's culture as the most veteran of faculty members, and we want them to embrace this responsibility wholeheartedly. \nAs faculty member Lynne Bartlett shared with the group upon arrival at the cabin, Proctor’s commitment to, and long standing relationship with, its surrounding land runs deep into the school’s history. The first student “Improvement Squads” were formed by faculty member Roland Burbank out of necessity during the Great Depression. Students not only ran an active vegetable garden on campus, but mowed the lawns, harvested cord wood for heating, and helped offset the maintenance costs of running the school by shoveling snow during the winter months. An early Improvement Squad project was to build a cabin in the woodlot to the north of campus proper. A Cabin Club was formed and the Proctor Cabin became an integral part of many students’ experiences. The current cabin was rebuilt on the same location as the original cabin in the early 1990s by a group of faculty. These tangible actions - physically constructing a place to share with others - have helped shape Proctor’s culture and commitment to spending time in the natural world over the past 90 years. \nEach year, we graduate a class of seniors (and employees), and find ourselves looking around during the summer months wondering how life at Proctor will go on with the Terry Stoecker, Karl Methven, Brooks Bicknell, or Class of 2023-sized holes in our community. And yet, each year, individuals step into the cultural void left by those who have graduated from Proctor. The essence of Proctor’s culture lies in the whole of all those who call this school home - alumni, students, faculty, staff, parents, parents of alumni - and we find our way forward, if imperfectly, passing our culture along to new students, new families, and new employees. \nThe building and sustaining of community is hard work. Regardless of how long we have called Proctor home or our role at this school, we each carry an equally critical responsibility to steward our community and our culture into the future. We are excited about the enthusiasm of the Class of 2027 and cannot wait to see how they impact our school over the next four years, and our goal is to encourage each of these ninth graders, “Do I want to passively embrace the culture that exists or do I want to actively shape it?” We are pretty sure the Class of 2027 will choose the latter. We cannot to look back at this group shot in May of 2027 as they prepare for graduation and reflect on the impact they had on Proctor. \nCheck out more photos from the Class of 2027 9th Grade Hike!",

Assistant for Student Life (603) 735-6647\nFinding a student on campus: Administration Office, Maxwell Savage (603) 735-6000\nRoommate issues: Kyle Tremblay, Dean of Residential Life (603) 735-6772\nBeing a Day Student: John Bouton, Assistant Dean of Day Students (603) 735-6628\nBanking\nYour student may open an account at Bar Harbor Bank & Trust. They can then have an ATM card for money. Suggestion: Have your name on the account to regulate account and spending.\nDorm Life - Moving\nSend minimal items the first time. Bring winter items up at Fall Family Weekend.\nIf your student has questions about dorms, roommates, etc. contact: Kyle Tremblay, Dean of Residential Life, tremblayky@proctoracademy.org or (603) 735-6772\nFor first time boarders it is great if they bring a picture of family and pets from home, stamps and an address book with names of family and friends, etc., detergent for the laundry in the dorm, a few posters, and a container to keep food and snacks organized. There are some storage areas in each dorm (basements can be damp in some cases, though.)\nFor students spending a term off-campus or needing summer storage, Proctor partners with Dorm Room Movers as a third party storage service. Learn more HERE.\nDorm Damage\nRemember the dorm is your student's home away from home. It is important that they respect it, and treat it as they would their own home. Dorm damage is expensive and any damage beyond normal wear and tear will be charged home at the end of the year.\nTravel\nRemember that airlines now can and often do charge for a third suitcase. Encourage your student to start ferrying things home during spring break or ship before the end of the year.\nUse Manchester Airport if you can - it is a bit more expensive, but much more convenient for the students.\nRemember that if your student is being picked up in Boston, MA, or Manchester, NH, following a vacation, the school-provided chartered transportation leaves at 5:30 PM. Make sure flights are in by then as they do not provide a late pick-up for late or delayed arrivals.\nThere is school-provided transportation from South Station in Boston, MA, after vacations, pick up is at 5:30 PM.\nInternational Travel\nForwarding agents do not take suitcases or bags. Courier services take them; however, it is expensive. It may be less expensive to pack everything in boxes and send it by mail. Delivery may take longer, so plan for extra time.\nProctor partners with Dorm Room Movers as a third party storage service. Learn more HERE.\nFor international student help contact Zhen Lei, International Student Coordinator.\nVisits\nArrive on Thursday afternoon for Fall Family Weekend. Join the golf tournament and then go to classes with your student Friday morning.\nThere are many scenic attractions you can take advantage of while here for a long weekend. The info booths on Routes 93 & 89 have all kinds of suggestions for places to go while visiting.\nIn the area there are a lot of good hiking trails - Ragged Mountain/Proctor, Mt. Kearsarge, Mt. Sunapee, even a short hike up the Blackwater, our ski area trails, can be fun.\nSkiing in the winter is great (even for the beginner.) Try Ragged Mountain or Mt. Sunapee for a day.\nMuseums are all around you. Kearsarge Indian Museum is a gem in Warner. Go up to Dartmouth College in Hanover and visit the Hood Museum. If you have brought younger siblings, a trip to the Montshire Museum (right across the river) in Norwich, VT, is a lot of fun.\nCheck out the New London/Sunapee Area Chamber web site for things to do while here.\nWhen you are in Concord, visit the AAA office at 2 Capital Plaza off Main Street. They have several discounts on area attractions, movies, and museums. These are available to members of AAA. It is open from 8:30-5:00 Mon-Fri. (800) 222-3422. A brochure is available listing all of the places that participate.\nWeekends\nStudents must have parental permission and a weekend travel pass complete (and approved) through Orah. Passes must be submitted by 12:30 PM on Friday.\nAcademics\nDon't hesitate to call or email faculty, advisor, or staff if you have a concern. They are interested in helping you sort out issues or answering questions.\nWhen you arrive for registration, you will receive a list with all your contacts for faculty, deans, dorm parents and advisor. This will help you know whom to talk to for problems.\nNew parents, develop a relationship with your student's advisor. The advisor is the conduit through which all information about your student should flow. Remember, however, your student's advisor is also teaching, coaching, and dorm parenting, so be patient with their response! \nWeekend Activities\nThe faculty weekend team is responsible for hosting, creating, and planning weekend events with support and guidance from the Student Activities Office and Student Leaders. A variety of on- and off-campus activities are offered. On-campus events may include dancers, concerts, and theater performances. Faculty also sponsor on-campus activities such as ultimate frisbee, orienteering, capture-the-flag, broomball, and ping-pong tournaments. Off-campus trips are taken to nearby cities (such as Concord, Boston, or Hanover) and colleges for cultural events, dinners, sporting events, and shopping. In addition, trips are taken to nearby climbing sites, local rivers for kayaking, ice climbing in the winter, ski areas, hiking, and local beaches for surfing. Some off-campus activities may involve additional costs.\nTips for Day Student Parents\nGeneral Advice \nWhom To Contact \nStudents Driving \nLockers \nGeneral Advice\nChoose one spot on campus to meet your child for evening pick-up. (The stone table outside the dining hall is a popular choice.)\nConsider hosting a boarding student over a weekend or short break. Students from afar appreciate a home-cooked meal and a break from the bustle of dorm life. This also connects boarders with day students in a healthy manner.\nDay students are welcome at all meals in the dining hall. Arriving a few minutes early for breakfast, or staying on campus for dinner is a great way to meet new friends.\nWhom To Contact\nWhen you have to contact your son or daughter during the day, first call the Main Desk at (603) 735-6000. Next, call the Health Center at (603) 735-6737 (cell phone weekends and evenings - (603) 344-0915.)\nIf you decide to keep your child at home due to bad weather or driving conditions, call the Health Center (603) 735-6737 if it is before 8:00 AM. If it is after 8:00 AM, call the main school line (603) 735-6000 or the Dean of Students office (603) 735-6646.\nIf you decide to keep your child at home due to illness, call the Health Center at (603) 735-6737.\nIf you have questions regarding a day student problem contact Assistant Dean of Day Students John Bouton at (603) 735-6628.\nStudents Driving\nFor a day student to drive to Proctor, a day student permission form must be filled out, signed by student and parents and returned to the Dean of Students' Office.\nAll parking for day students is next to the field house. The car must remain there until it's time to go home. No driving on campus!\nFor a boarding student to ride in a day student’s car, the boarder must have a Riding Permission Form signed and filed with the Dean of Students, and the boarder must sign out at the dormitory and call the Administrator On Duty at 603-491-9282.\nLockers\nThere are lockers available in the field house and outside the Wise Center. Lockers will be assigned to each student for their personal use. Locks are available in the PIN room through the athletic department. (If you prefer, you may bring your own lock.)",

  "text": "Eras of Leadership\nProctor has benefitted from stable, wise, and visionary leadership over the past eight decades. The product of that leadership is evident in the school we know today - a school who knows itself well and whose mission is lived out clearly by a dedicated faculty and staff who have committed their lives to Proctor and its educational model. \nThe following is a brief history of the school—chaptered by its leaders—over eighty years.\nHalsey Gulick 1935-1952 \nLyle Farrell 1952-1971 \nDavid Fowler 1971-1995 \nSteve Wilkins 1995-2005 \nMike Henriques 2005-2021 \nBrian Thomas 2021-Present \nHalsey Gulick 1935-1952\nHalsey Gulick became Head of School at a time of economic desperation at Proctor leading him to find \"win-win\" situations that benefited students and the school. A \"General Course\" was offered for boys seeking practical skills in machine work, woodworking, carpentry, boat building, and auto mechanics. “Improvement Squads\" built tennis courts, mowed lawns, fought fires, delivered coal, constructed The Cabin, cut ski trails and installed a rope tow lift. It was on this foundation that Proctor’s “Skills” classes in the arts evolved and a culture of service became rooted in the community.\nLyle Farrell 1952-1971\nLyle Farrell's tenure as Head of School focused on strengthened academics, growing student enrollment and the construction of new facilities. Nicknamed \"the great builder,\" Farrell turned to Trustees for financial support of capital projects including an addition to Maxwell Savage Hall, Shirley Hall, athletic fields, the Proctor Ski Area and Farrell Field House. However, Farrell's greatest impact was establishing an academic support program inspired by the research of Samuel T. Orton providing opportunities for bright, hard-working students with learning differences.\nDavid Fowler 1971-1995\nAn iconoclastic visionary, David Fowler empowered Proctor's faculty to define the policies and programs of their school. The result was revolutionary. Proctor became co-educational immediately.

He was attracted to Proctor because of its deep commitment to experiential learning, the off-campus experience of its students, and its educational model rooted in supporting, embracing, and challenging all learning styles. During his first two years at Proctor, Brian has evolved the school’s leadership structure and challenged the school to extend access to students farthest from opportunity, while immersing himself in all Proctor has to offer.",
  "markdown": "## Eras of Leadership\n\nProctor has benefitted from stable, wise, and visionary leadership over the past eight decades. The product of that leadership is evident in the school we know today - a school who knows itself well and whose mission is lived out clearly by a dedicated faculty and staff who have committed their lives to Proctor and its educational model. \n\nThe following is a brief history of the school—chaptered by its leaders—over eighty years.  \n \n\n*   [Halsey Gulick 1935-1952](#fs-panel-3387)\n*   [Lyle Farrell 1952-1971](#fs-panel-3389)\n*   [David Fowler 1971-1995](#fs-panel-3391)\n*   [Steve Wilkins 1995-2005](#fs-panel-3393)\n*   [Mike Henriques 2005-2021](#fs-panel-3395)\n*   [Brian Thomas 2021-Present](#fs-panel-3397)\n\n## [Halsey Gulick 1935-1952](#fs-panel-3387)\n\nHalsey Gulick became Head of School at a time of economic desperation at Proctor leading him to find \"win-win\" situations that benefited students and the school. A \"General Course\" was offered for boys seeking practical skills in machine work, woodworking, carpentry, boat building, and auto mechanics. “Improvement Squads\" built tennis courts, mowed lawns, fought fires, delivered coal, constructed The Cabin, cut ski trails and installed a rope tow lift. It was on this foundation that Proctor’s “Skills” classes in the arts evolved and a culture of service became rooted in the community.\n\n## [Lyle Farrell 1952-1971](#fs-panel-3389)\n\nLyle Farrell's tenure as Head of School focused on strengthened academics, growing student enrollment and the construction of new facilities. Nicknamed \"the great builder,\" Farrell turned to Trustees for financial support of capital projects including an addition to Maxwell Savage Hall, Shirley Hall, athletic fields, the Proctor Ski Area and Farrell Field House. However, Farrell's greatest impact was establishing an academic support program inspired by the research of Samuel T. Orton providing opportunities for bright, hard-working students with learning differences.\n\n## [David Fowler 1971-1995](#fs-panel-3391)\n\nAn iconoclastic visionary, David Fowler empowered Proctor's faculty to define the policies and programs of their school. The result was revolutionary. Proctor became co-educational immediately. Relationships between students and faculty became informal and non-adversarial; seniority systems were abolished, and the value of hands-on, real-world educational experience was reflected in Wilderness Orientation, Project Period, Mountain Classroom, and language immersion programs in Spain and France. To nurture Proctor's \"soul,\" David introduced regular all-school assemblies at which anyone was welcome to speak. The school found and embraced distinctly human values.\n\n## [Steve Wilkins 1995-2005](#fs-panel-3393)\n\nA lifelong student of teaching methodologies and learning styles, Steve Wilkins led Proctor on a decade of self-analysis studying everything from sleep needs and the academic schedule to gender issues in classrooms.

  "text": "Meet Head of School Brian Thomas\nOn July 1, 2021, Brian Thomas began his tenure as Proctor's next Head of School. A native of Robbins and Harvey, Illinois (on Chicago’s far south side), Brian graduated from Yale University (BA in History) and Portland State University (MS in Education), and has spent thirty years in independent school education preparing for this opportunity to lead Proctor.\nOver the past two years, Brian has immersed himself in the Proctor community, learning the complexities, personalities, and uniqueness of the school. Brian notes, “The Proctor Academy of today fits more than just our current context, it thrums with the fierce urgency to do things that matter deeply to those of us who are fortunate enough to be here now and hereafter. Proctor prepares students to build their lives, to make things better for others, and to internalize lessons that will sustain all of us for generations to come. Be it on the fields of play or in one of the many classroom spaces near and far, we give our all and do our best. We embody our motto - Live to Learn. Learn to Live. – to enable students to find meaning and purpose in their lives. In every aspect of our expansive educational model, we capture and guide the engaged and passionate young mind to be more than they ever thought they could be.” \nPrior to Proctor, Brian served as the Assistant Head of School at Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School, a PreK-Grade 12 independent day school in St. Louis (MO) that serves more than 1,200 students.

His early teaching career included roles as English Teacher, English Department Head, Humanities Coordinator, and baseball and basketball coach.

Balanced Rock and the Bulkhead\nThe Wisconsin glacier broke off the east shoulder of Ragged Mountain some 20,000 years ago. Today, this granite outcropping, known as The Bulkhead, is a destination for campers, rock-climbers and those looking for spectacular vistas to the east and south. A hike to The Bulkhead takes approximately 90 minutes. From here, one can see Proctor’s campus, Elbow Pond, The Proctor Ski Area and Mount Kearsarge.\n2. Tennis Courts\nLocated immediately above and west of Farrell Field House, ten new tennis courts were constructed in 2002. They are home to Proctor's four spring tennis teams and recreational tennis program, and are used widely by residents of Andover. \n3. Mike Henriques and Betsy Paine Outdoor Center\nConstructed in 2020, the Proctor Outdoor Center serves as a physical home for Proctor’s robust outdoor programs including, alpine skiing, ski jumping, freeskiing, kayaking, mountain biking, cycling, rock climbing, Wilderness Orientation, and Mountain Classroom. Featuring state of the art tuning rooms and workshops, as well as an indoor climbing wall and storage areas, the facility serves as a gateway to Proctor’s 2,500 acres of trails, rivers, ponds, and wilderness.\n4. Teddy Maloney ‘88 Hockey Rink\n“The Ted” is one of the region’s finest hockey venues, with an all-new refrigeration system, new locker rooms, a new roof structure and state-of-the-art lighting. This beautiful rink is dedicated to the memory Teddy Maloney 88’, a former varsity boys’ hockey captain who lost his life at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. His death sparked a fundraising drive orchestrated by many of Teddy’s classmates and friends. The locker rooms in \"The Ted\" serve all three seasons of Proctor teams and welcome thousands of local youth skaters to the facility each winter. \n5. Mud Pond\nThis remote beaver pond is easily accessible by a network of trails. Tent platforms, a fire ring and beautiful views make this a favorite campsite for students and teachers. Moose, deer, blue heron and wood ducks are frequent visitors to Mud Pond.\n6. The Proctor Cabin\nThe original cabin was constructed in 1943 by a student work team high above campus on the south face of Ragged Mountain. A new cabin replaced it in 1991. With a wood stove and upstairs loft, The Cabin is a great destination for student groups and classes. In addition, students with specific permission may camp at the Cabin on weekends. Fresh water is available from a stream to the west, and hiking trails lead on to The Bulkhead and other campsites.\n7. Johnson House Dormitory\nOne of the three sister dorms built in 1978, Johnson House is a dormitory for 12 students situated at the foot of Ragged Mountain. With windows facing south, and thick insulation throughout, Johnson is one of Proctor’s many environmentally responsible residences. Situated high above Farrell Field, Johnson House provides great views of campus, the Proctor Ski Area, the Blackwater River Valley, and Mount Kearsarge. Hiking and biking trails extend northward from the back door.\n8. Burbank East and West Dormitory\nBurbank East and Burbank West are under one roof, but are two separate student dormitories. They are home to Proctor’s 9th Grade Program. “The Burbs” are popular for their spacious, modern rooms, comfortable common spaces and great views of campus and immediate access to the Farrell Field Complex. It’s a short walk to the dining room and all athletic facilities, and Mud Pond Trail leads up Ragged Mountain from the back door.\n9. Davis House Dormitory\nOne of the three sister dorms constructed in 1978, Davis House is popular dormitory for 12 students. Named for generous benefactor Al Davis, this dorm is situated high above Farrell Field, Davis House offers fine views to the south and southwest. Hiking and biking trails extend northward from back entrance.\n10. Summerfield Dormitory\nNamed for Chuck Summerfield ‘72, who died in an accident shortly after his graduation, this is one of the three sister dorms built in 1978. A south-facing dorm for 12 students, Summerfield is one of many environmentally responsible residences. Hiking and biking trails extend northward from the back entrance.\n11. Hopkins/Adder Pond\nAlso known as Adder Pond, this remote lake is stocked with trout in the spring. Trails lead to Mountain Classroom past the north shore, where a fire ring invites campers.\n12. The Sauna and Elbow Pond House\nA home base for Proctor’s Mountain Classroom program, the Elbow Pond House is home to a faculty/staff member and served as a dormitory from 2011-2017 when the decision was made to bring all boarding students on the campus proper. Situated overlooking spring-fed Elbow Pond about three miles from campus, Elbow Pond House provides housing for visiting guests and friends of Proctor.\n13. Elbow Pond\nElbow Pond serves as home base for Mountain Classroom between voyages, serves as a faculty residence, and a popular swimming destination for Proctor families throughout the summer months. Its pristine and deep waters, fed by springs and Mountain Brook, make it the school’s most popular swimming spot. A swim dock and boathouse are located near the south end. Elbow Pond hosts a polar swim each week (even in the winter!) for daring community members.\n14. Elbow Pond Boathouse\nOriginally used as a true boat house for sailing teams, the boat house at Elbow Pond now serves a lean-to and place to change for those desiring to take a dip in the cold, spring fed waters of Elbow Pond during the summer months, or for those intrepid souls who dare to take part in the ritual of Polar Swim.\n15. Farrell Field House\nThis facility, dedicated in 1970 to honor Lyle Harlan Farrell for thirty-eight years of service, was completely renovated in 2018 and houses athletics offices, the gymnasium, a state of the art fitness center, seven academic classrooms, the History Department, locker and shower rooms, extensive athletic training facilities. The Farrell Field House is among the finest basketball venues in the Lakes Region and plays host to local tournaments, Special Olympics New Hampshire basketball and weight lifting events, and serves as an indoor practice space for spring teams during seasons of significant snow fall. The Farrell Field House is a hub of activity during all hours of the day. \n16. Farrell Field Turf Complex\nFarmland was excavated in 1957 to provide athletic fields for baseball, soccer, lacrosse, and eventually field hockey. In the summer of 2012, the school completed the $1.9 million installation of two synthetic playing fields, one illuminated for night games and general recreation. The 70,000 square-foot north field provides NCAA-sized surfaces for field hockey and boys’ lacrosse. The lit 93,100 square-foot east field hosts soccer and girls’ lacrosse, and is lined for football and boys’ lacrosse, allowing all sports to play under the lights. These fields are constructed for easy snow removal, enabling an early start to the lacrosse season. A natural-turf softball field is positioned to the southwest, with home plate situated at the conjunction of the synthetic fields.\n17. Peabody Dormitory\nPeabody House is a desirable central location on campus. It was built in 2008 to replace the long-standing Morton House. Home to two faculty families and sixteen residents, Peabody House utilizes geothermal heating and cooling and is built with sustainability in mind. In fact, all of its hardwood floors are a recycled basketball floor from a nearby college! Peabody’s southerly exposure and passive solar energy heat its spacious commons rooms. This dorm overlooks the Farrell Field Complex and Proctor Ski Area across the valley.\n18. Health Center\nOnce a Congregational church for the people of Andover, this charming little chapel became the school infirmary in the 1950s. Dedicated in 1967 as Malnati Infirmary in honor of Head of School Lyle Farrell’s sister Helen Malnati, who served as Head Nurse for many years, this facility was renovated in the 1990s as a full service health center, with 7 beds, an evaluation room and a spacious welcoming area. The belfry atop the Health Center houses a historic bell original to the building.\n19. Johnson Family Sugar House \nThe Sugar House, an extension of the Forestry Department, is busy throughout the months of March and early April. Maple sugaring is one of the most popular spring projects; dozens of students gather sap from the school’s extensive stand of maples, boil the sap, stoke fires, and finally pour and bottle the syrup.\nIn 2015, an architectural design course took on the task of remodeling the Sugar Shack. It was a perfect hands on project, giving students the chance to build and design a project that would be used by the Proctor community. It was subsequently dedicated the Johnson Family Sugarhouse. Ask for a bottle of maple syrup when you visit!\n20. Woodlands Office\nThe Woodlands Office serves as home base for the Woodland Manager. Proctor’s 2,500 acres are a tremendous resource for both the Proctor and local community, and the Woodlands Office is often the meeting place for forestry and wildlife science classes, local hiking groups, and visiting logging/forestry organizations discussing Proctor’s complex land use policies.\n21. Proctor Woodlands Building\nConstructed in 2022 to serve as an academic and physical gateway to Proctor’s 2,500 acres of woodlands, the Woodland Center features two laboratory classrooms, a state of the art greenhouse, and large, open gathering space with woodstove. Home to life sciences and courses from across departments looking for a window into the woodlands, the building was designed to utilize all local timbers, harvested on Proctor’s land near Elbow Pond. It is one of Proctor’s most ecologically friendly constructions.\n22. Gulick House Dormitory\nOnce a private home on North Street, Gulick House was acquired early in the 20th Century as the residence for Head of School J. Halsey Gulick. It was a boys’ dormitory throughout the 1950s, ‘60s and ‘70s. In 1987, Gulick House was extensively renovated and is now a popular dorm for 12 students.\n23. Mary Lowell Stone House Dormitory\nKnown to students and faculty as “MLS,” this popular boys’ dormitory was originally built as the Moulton House Inn in the 1870s. One of many Proctor structures named for Unitarian educational leaders from Cambridge, Massachusetts, Mary Lowell Stone is home to 17 students, with an apartment for a single faculty member and one for a faculty family. MLS is popular for its central location on North Street and its spacious dorm rooms.\n24. Sally B. Dormitory\nCompleted in the fall of 2013, Sally B Dormitory provides 16 students and two faculty families a beautiful new home. Proctor’s commitment to the highest residential life standards led to the building of a sixteen-student, two faculty family dormitory immediately to the east of Mary Lowell Stone House. Drawing on the classic, New England architectural lines of Mary Lowell Stone, the dormitory features suite-configured bedrooms. It was built to exacting environmental standards in line with the school’s Environmental Mission Statement. The project includes extensive improvements to adjacent landscapes, including off-street parking for three dormitories, and clearly delineated work areas for the Forestry and Land Use Departments. The official groundbreaking was on May 4, 2013 and dedication of Sally B was on November 16, 2013.\n25. Leonard Field\nProctor’s first athletic field was used by football teams for decades before it was formally dedicated to Mrs. Hazel Clark-Leonard in October, 1960. Today, Leonard Field is the home of football and boys’ junior varsity lacrosse.\n26. Organic Community Garden\nStudents, faculty and friends all cooperate in this venture, growing lettuce, basil, carrots, chard, spinach, tomatoes, tomatillos, onions, garlic, mustard greens and nasturtiums. Produce from the garden augments the salad bar through the summer, and, to some extent, throughout the year (basil pesto and other herbs freeze well!). While this garden’s history is only a decade old, organic gardening is a long-standing tradition at Proctor, going back to extensive “victory gardens” in the early 1940s.\n27. MacKenzie House Dormitory\nMackenzie House was a private home until the 1950s, when it was purchased to serve as a boys’ dormitory. Renovated extensively in the ‘90s, “Mac House” is now a popular dormitory for students.\n29. West End Dormitory\nBuilt in the fall of 2016 after a fire destroyed Thoreau House in June of 2016, West End dorm sits adjacent to Cortland House, anchoring the west end of campus. Home to a faculty family and thirteen boarding students, the dorm’s large windows and spacious rooms provide an ideal location across the driveway from the Brown Dining Commons and the Farrell Field House.\n30. Brown Dining Commons\nThe Proctor Dining Commons became the first dedicated dining facility in the school’s history in October, 2016. The ‘greenest’ building constructed on Proctor’s campus, the Dining Commons utilizes geothermal heating/cooling, state of the art insulation, and food processing equipment. The Dining Commons has stunning southerly views over Carr Field and the Proctor Ski Area.\n31. Fowler Learning Center\nThe Alice and David Fowler Learning Center is the crown jewel of our academic facilities. It was dedicated in June, 1994, in honor of David Fowler’s retirement (after 30 years at Proctor, including 25 years as Head of School). This building was inspired by a Quaker barn and celebrates the legacy of both David and Alice Fowler. A stunning, open atrium on the east side connects Information Technology with the Lovejoy Library and Learning Skills. The Fowler Learning Center immediately gained national attention in architectural magazines, and was honored for its successful integration of small-town, New England style with state-of-the-art technologies.\n32. Farm House Dormitory\nThe Farm House was once home to Andover’s Fenton family and was acquired by the school in the 1950s. The original barn was rebuilt to become a dormitory for seven students, while the main house is a spacious and comfortable faculty residence.\n33. Proctor Pond\nA stream was dammed by a student “Improvement team” in the 1940s to create the school’s first skating rink. Boards and lights were installed in the 1950’s, as ice hockey became a major winter sport. After an indoor ice rink was installed (near the present facility,) the pond was dredged and a retaining wall was constructed on the east end. Today, Proctor Pond serves many purposes. It is a reservoir for campus irrigation systems, a home to wildlife and, once plowed, a central skating pond. Each winter, we build bonfires at the edge of the pond and play intramural broomball.\n34. Jaxtimer Fire Pit\n35. Wilkins Meeting House\n“The Meeting House” is one of the most architecturally and aesthetically beautiful facilities in central New Hampshire. Designed in the image of a Shaker barn, the Meeting House is a physical metaphor for Proctor values. Here, the whole community assembles for daily assemblies at which anyone may speak. Dance studios, a blackbox theater, costume shops, a huge stage tech facility and the Cotton Projection Room surround the 410-seat Norris Family Theater. The Meeting House brings people together, to be their best. This is what Proctor is all about. The Meeting House was opened in 2001, and was named in honor of Steve Wilkins, who was Head of School from 1994-2005, and his wife Sarah, who taught in the Learning Skills Department.\nIn 2013, 273 photovoltaic solar panels were installed on the roof of the Wilkins Meeting House. These panels generate more than 70,000 KW hours of renewable electricity per year. \n36. Recording Studio\nThe recording studio is, in the words of the designer, “The finest teaching recording studio in the world.” While the technology inside gives students the ability to mix tracks like professionals, it is the vibration insulation that catches the attention of national media. A writer for an acoustic design magazine noted, “Each room is suspended by thousands of rubber pads against the outside wall, so that a heavy truck passing by on North Street (which would be rare) will have no discernible vibration in the performance spaces or the recording studio... No one has ever seen anything like this. And then there’s the recording technology!” In recording classes, each student designs unique mixes of music, which is displayed on a projection screen for other students to appreciate and evaluate. Visit this space when it’s in action, with jazz/rock playing in the studio, with the recording team working the state-of-the-art sound systems.\n37. Imagination Inn Day Care Facility\nThis facility houses a fun, highly successful day care program for thirty children, many of whom are employee children. Ten loving providers are seen pushing large carts loaded with smiling, sometimes sleepy, kids through campus at all hours of the day. The facility is privately run although property of the school.\n38. Phelps House\nTucked away as the eastern most building on Proctor’s campus, Phelps House serves a faculty residence.\n39. English House\n40. Cortland House Dormitory\nCortland House is home to one faculty family and four students. The historic home was purchased by the school in 2014 and provides large, sunny rooms in a small, family style dormitory with a large backyard and easy access to athletic facilities and the Dining Commons.\n41. Farr Cottage\nNamed for Headmaster Theodore “Teddy” Parker Farr, Farr Cottage is a faculty residence.\n42. Carriage House Dormitory\nThe cottage at the west end, now a faculty residence, housed horse-drawn carriages in the 19th Century as a part of the Proctor and Carr Family estate. A new dormitory, built to exacting environmental standards, was completed in 1998. A classroom separates the east wing from the west wing. For decades, Carriage House served as an Environmental themed dormitory, and in 2022 became the school's first all-gender dorm. Students in Carriage House live with intentionality as they craft their dorm community. \n43. Carr House Dormitory\nThis charming, Greek-revival colonial was built by John Proctor in the 1870s, and was renovated by the Carr family eighty years ago. Acquired by the school in the 1950s, Carr House is a popular dormitory for 18 students. The building retains many charming accents from its history as a grand home: dentil trim and fine molding, bull’s eye glass, rare patio tiles, and linen closets in a maid’s apartment. The original living room now serves as the dorm’s common space, located across the front hall from the faculty apartment.\n44. Rulon-Miller Dormitory\nThe front “Cape” of this facility was a local residence from 1848 until 1980, when it was purchased by the school. At that time, the old barn that was attached to the back was moved across campus to become the Robert Wilson Forestry Building, and a new two-story dormitory, housing 12 students, was built in its place. The original, front cape serves as the faculty apartment. This dorm is named for an active alumnus from the Class of 1957, who served as a Trustee from 1970 until his passing in 2011.\n45. Ives House Dormitory \nNamed for Henry C. Ives, a scholarly instructor who served as Head of School in 1904, this dormitory is popular for its central location and architectural charm. It has a home-like feel, and the 12 students who live in Ives enjoy spacious rooms and a short walk to most classes.\n46. Shirley Hall\nShirley Hall was completed in 1962, and was one of several significant construction projects completed during Lyle Farrell’s tenure. He served as Head of School from 1952 to 1971, and was proud to promote physical improvements to campus, referring to himself as “The Great Builder.” The building was named for William R. Shirley, class of 1916, who drew the architectural lines and donated to the project. Originally, the main floor housed the library and science labs, while the lower level featured Learning skills and the Mathematics department. In 1994, Shirley was significantly remodeled, and now the Science Department is on the top floor, with the Mathematics Department downstairs.\n47. Slocumb Hall\nThis charming building was constructed in the 1870s as a livery stable (for the horses that drew carriages from the railroad station to the Proctor House Hotel). It was extensively renovated one hundred years ago by H. Langford Warren, Dean of the Architecture School at Harvard University. After the renovation, it was used as Proctor’s gymnasium for the better part of the 20th century, with shower rooms on the north side. Slocumb was improved in 2009 with new insulation, windows, and added space, and is now home to studio art, ceramics, and a photography darkroom.\n48. Alan Shepard Boat House\nBoat building has a long, colorful history at Proctor. Since the 1930s, hundreds of rowboats, sailing dinghies, canoes and kayaks have been built here. If you’re curious about what it takes to build a boat, here’s what one alum had to say.\nWhen Alan Shepard was a boy– long before he became America’s first astronaut in space-– he spent a summer building a boat at Proctor. In 1961, when Shepard became a national hero, we named the old shop in his honor!\nToday, the top floor is still home to woodshop and boat building classes. Downstairs, metal engineering, blacksmithing, and jewelry classes meet.\n49. The Walt Wright ‘48 Biomass Plant\nThe Walt Wright ‘48 Biomass Plant was built in 2008, transforming Proctor’s 50 year old oil powered central steam plant into an energy efficient, biomass plant powered by local wood chips harvested off of Proctor's land. The plant has reduced Proctor’s heating oil consumption by more than 75% each year, connecting all major buildings throughout campus and allowing Proctor to live out its environmental mission statement. \n50. Newell Service Building\nBusiness Office / HR / Maintenance / Housekeeping \nThe Newell Service Building, known jokingly as “the Garage Majal,” is a high-tech facility for Proctor’s many service vehicles, including bio-diesel trucks, gators and tractors. The top floor is home to the Business Office, Human Resources, Maintenance, and Housekeeping.\n51. Maxwell Savage Hall / Wise Community Center\nMaxwell Savage was completed in 1932 after the first Academic Building was destroyed by fire in 1931. It is the most prominent and recognizable building on campus. Named for a well-known Unitarian minister, Maxwell Savage is the main administrative building, while also serving as home to the world language department, the student mail room, and the bookstore. The bell atop Maxwell, as the students call it, rings to call the school together for morning assemblies and to celebrate team road victories. The back addition, built in 1958, is home to the English Department and connects to the Wise community center.\nThe Wise Center space was original constructed as Holland Auditorium in 1958, where it was home to all-school assemblies and Proctor Drama until the Norris Family Theater opened in the Meeting House in 2001. Through the generosity of a generous alumni and trustees, this space was completely rebuilt as the Ruby and Bill Wise ‘39 Community Center. Known on campus simply as “The Wise,” this is the place where students go to relax with friends, grab a bite to eat from the grill, or play pool and ping pong in the evenings.\n52. Stone Chapel\nThe Stone Chapel, a historic Tudor built in 1910, serves many purposes for the Proctor and Andover community. It was completely rebuilt in 2005, and served as home to the school’s popular voice and chorus programs throughout the first two decades of the 2000s. The sanctuary of the original chapel serves as both a practice and performance space. Downstairs are practice rooms, where sopranos, tenors, baritones and bass singers practice in soundproofed spaces. On Sundays, the Chapel is used by the community as a Unitarian Church.\n53. Fowler House Dormitory\nLocated on the Town Green, Fowler House was the residence for heads of school and their families; Lyle Farrell lived there from 1952-1971 and David Fowler was there from 1971 to 1994. The building was subsequently completely renovated to become a dormitory for twelve students and two faculty families.\n54. Gannett House Dormitory\nA dormitory for eighteen students, Gannett House was designed 1909 by H. Langford Warren, the founder of the architecture school at Harvard University. Renovated significantly in 1990, it now offers three double rooms and twelve singles on the second and third floors. The dorm is named for the renowned 19th Century Unitarian leader Ezra Stiles Gannet. \n55. The Barn\nOriginally constructed in Center Harbor, New Hampshire, the barn was disassembled piece-by-piece and rebuilt at the east end of the central campus as part of a Fall Family Weekend project in 1974. Today, it is the occasional home to faculty livestock. \n56. Carr Field\nSituated immediately across the road from four dormitories, Carr Field offers three playing fields for soccer and lacrosse teams, as well as a new baseball diamond installed in 2013. Originally pasture land, Carr Field was graded in 1979 and is fully irrigated with water from the Blackwater River, which flows below its southern bluff. The field is named in honor of the Carr Family, who supported the school throughout the early 1900s and sold their extensive land holdings to the school in the late 1960s.\n57. The Head’s House\nAcquired by the school in 1994 to serve as the residence for the Head of School and family, this building was originally built for John Proctor’s brother, William, in the 1870s. The Head’s Residence was extensively remodeled in 2005, and again updated in 2021 in order to host guest speakers and other special guests to campus. The backyard is a popular spot for receptions, trustee cookouts and other social gatherings.\n58. Ferguson House\n59. Proctor Ski Area and Bill Paine '52 Nordic Center\nThe finest school-owned ski facility in the United States, the Proctor Ski Area offers three slopes, extensive snow-making, and three ski jumps all under the lights. Opened in 1971, the Proctor Ski Area was enhanced in the late ‘90s with the addition of Yarrow’s Lodge, and again from 2009-2015 when top to bottom lighting and snow making on FIS alpine trails, as well as a FIS homologated Nordic course with snow making were installed. The Proctor Ski Area won the Golden Eagle Award for Environmental Excellence in 2014. Extensive cross-country trails, including the beautiful Holley Trails, complete the valley’s snow sport facilities.\nMore than 90% of The Proctor Ski Area is powered by solar energy. All of the lights, pumps, lifts and the lodge are powered exclusively by solar. In 2015, 250,000 kwh of photovoltaic solar panels were installed on 4 buildings and at The Proctor Ski area.\nBill Paine ‘52 Nordic Center\nHome to one of the finest FIS homologated Nordic loops in New Hampshire, the Bill Paine ‘52 Nordic Center opened for use in December 2015. The 1.5 km sprint loop features full snow-making, while the full 2.8 km homologated trail system provides an unparalleled Nordic training and racing venue for Proctor’s Nordic team as well as local high school teams from around the region.\nNorris Ski Jump\nProctor’s ski jumping program was created by legendary coach Tim Norris, who continues to help future Olympians realize their dreams. Tim came to Proctor in 1962. He coaches local kids, many of whom come to Proctor to further their careers as national and international qualifiers. 30- and 15-meter jumps benefit from top-to-bottom snow-making and lighting, making this facility the finest in New Hampshire.\n60. Yarrow’s Lodge\nYarrow’s Lodge has two stories of wood-heated space for relaxing, changing in and out of ski gear, a quick meal, and entertainment. Downstairs is all business. Upstairs, you can relax with views of the race course, purchase burgers and shakes, or step out on the immense south-facing deck, where a grill serves up more delicacies. Yarrow’s Lodge is a campus social center from December to March.\n61. Community House\nFormerly the Blackwater Ski Shop, an iconic small town ski shop, the Proctor Community House is now home to the student-run Proctor Coffee House and Community program. The relaxed atmosphere downstairs provides an alternate student hangout on the weekends, while the pingpong table, full kitchen, and open space on the second floor provide a unique meeting space for classes and other groups on campus.\n62. King House Dormitory\nRenovated by a local entrepreneur in the 1970s, this dormitory for nine students was purchased and dedicated to trustee Alfred King in 1981. Students occupy the first floor of King House, and a spacious faculty apartment is upstairs. King House is popular for its central location and home-style rooms.\n63. Proctor Block\nAdmissions / Development & Alumni / Communications \nOnce the village’s most prominent building, the Proctor Block was built in the 1870s as a municipal facility. John Proctor, a local tycoon, financed its construction as part of an extensive town improvement project.. It once had a third floor, but it was destroyed by fire a century ago. Over the years, different parts of the Proctor Block have served as a town hall, a U.S. post office and even a hamburger joint! Proctor purchased it 1983, and it was renovated for history classrooms (upstairs) and Admissions and Development offices downstairs. Today, Admissions occupies the entire first floor, and Communications and Development operate out of the upper level.\n64. Shirley House\n65. Cangiano House\nLocated a stone’s throw down Lawrence Street and gifted to Proctor in 2008, Cangiano House is home to three faculty families.

A south-facing dorm for 12 students, Summerfield is one of many environmentally responsible residences. Hiking and biking trails extend northward from the back entrance.\n\n## [11\\. Hopkins/Adder Pond](#fs-panel-2952)\n\nAlso known as Adder Pond, this remote lake is stocked with trout in the spring. Trails lead to Mountain Classroom past the north shore, where a fire ring invites campers.\n\n## [12\\. The Sauna and Elbow Pond House](#fs-panel-2920)\n\nA home base for Proctor’s Mountain Classroom program, the Elbow Pond House is home to a faculty/staff member and served as a dormitory from 2011-2017 when the decision was made to bring all boarding students on the campus proper. Situated overlooking spring-fed Elbow Pond about three miles from campus, Elbow Pond House provides housing for visiting guests and friends of Proctor.\n\n## [13\\. Elbow Pond](#fs-panel-2916)\n\nElbow Pond serves as home base for Mountain Classroom between voyages, serves as a faculty residence, and a popular swimming destination for Proctor families throughout the summer months. Its pristine and deep waters, fed by springs and Mountain Brook, make it the school’s most popular swimming spot. A swim dock and boathouse are located near the south end. Elbow Pond hosts a polar swim each week (even in the winter!) for daring community members.\n\n## [14\\. Elbow Pond Boathouse](#fs-panel-2924)\n\nOriginally used as a true boat house for sailing teams, the boat house at Elbow Pond now serves a lean-to and place to change for those desiring to take a dip in the cold, spring fed waters of Elbow Pond during the summer months, or for those intrepid souls who dare to take part in the  ritual of Polar Swim.\n\n## [15\\. Farrell Field House](#fs-panel-2829)\n\nThis facility, dedicated in 1970 to honor Lyle Harlan Farrell for thirty-eight years of service, was completely renovated in 2018 and houses athletics offices, the gymnasium, a state of the art fitness center, seven academic classrooms, the History Department, locker and shower rooms, extensive athletic training facilities. The Farrell Field House is among the finest basketball venues in the Lakes Region and plays host to local tournaments, Special Olympics New Hampshire basketball and weight lifting events, and serves as an indoor practice space for spring teams during seasons of significant snow fall. The Farrell Field House is a hub of activity during all hours of the day. \n\n## [16\\. Farrell Field Turf Complex](#fs-panel-2901)\n\nFarmland was excavated in 1957 to provide athletic fields for baseball, soccer, lacrosse, and eventually field hockey. In the summer of 2012, the school completed the $1.9 million installation of two synthetic playing fields, one illuminated for night games and general recreation. The 70,000 square-foot north field provides NCAA-sized surfaces for field hockey and boys’ lacrosse. The lit 93,100 square-foot east field hosts soccer and girls’ lacrosse, and is lined for football and boys’ lacrosse, allowing all sports to play under the lights. These fields are constructed for easy snow removal, enabling an early start to the lacrosse season. A natural-turf softball field is positioned to the southwest, with home plate situated at the conjunction of the synthetic fields.\n\n## [17\\. Peabody Dormitory](#fs-panel-2859)\n\nPeabody House is a desirable central location on campus. It was built in 2008 to replace the long-standing Morton House. Home to two faculty families and sixteen residents, Peabody House utilizes geothermal heating and cooling and is built with sustainability in mind. In fact, all of its hardwood floors are a recycled basketball floor from a nearby college! Peabody’s southerly exposure and passive solar energy heat its spacious commons rooms. This dorm overlooks the Farrell Field Complex and Proctor Ski Area across the valley.\n\n## [18\\. Health Center](#fs-panel-2905)\n\nOnce a Congregational church for the people of Andover, this charming little chapel became the school infirmary in the 1950s. Dedicated in 1967 as Malnati Infirmary in honor of Head of School Lyle Farrell’s sister Helen Malnati, who served as Head Nurse for many years, this facility was renovated in the 1990s as a full service health center, with 7 beds, an evaluation room and a spacious welcoming area. The belfry atop the Health Center houses a historic bell original to the building.\n\n## [19\\. Johnson Family Sugar House](#fs-panel-2907)\n\nThe Sugar House, an extension of the Forestry Department, is busy throughout the months of March and early April. Maple sugaring is one of the most popular spring projects; dozens of students gather sap from the school’s extensive stand of maples, boil the sap, stoke fires, and finally pour and bottle the syrup.\n\nIn 2015, an architectural design course took on the task of remodeling the Sugar Shack. It was a perfect hands on project, giving students the chance to build and design a project that would be used by the Proctor community. It was subsequently dedicated the Johnson Family Sugarhouse. Ask for a bottle of maple syrup when you visit!\n\n## [20\\. Woodlands Office](#fs-panel-2936)\n\nThe Woodlands Office serves as home base for the Woodland Manager. Proctor’s 2,500 acres are a tremendous resource for both the Proctor and local community, and the Woodlands Office is often the meeting place for forestry and wildlife science classes, local hiking groups, and visiting logging/forestry organizations discussing Proctor’s complex land use policies.\n\n## [21\\. Proctor Woodlands Building](#fs-panel-4673)\n\nConstructed in 2022 to serve as an academic and physical gateway to Proctor’s 2,500 acres of woodlands, the Woodland Center features two laboratory classrooms, a state of the art greenhouse, and large, open gathering space with woodstove.

MLS is popular for its central location on North Street and its spacious dorm rooms.\n\n## [24\\. Sally B. Dormitory](#fs-panel-2867)\n\nCompleted in the fall of 2013, Sally B Dormitory provides 16 students and two faculty families a beautiful new home. Proctor’s commitment to the highest residential life standards led to the building of a sixteen-student, two faculty family dormitory immediately to the east of Mary Lowell Stone House. Drawing on the classic, New England architectural lines of Mary Lowell Stone, the dormitory features suite-configured bedrooms. It was built to exacting environmental standards in line with the school’s Environmental Mission Statement. The project includes extensive improvements to adjacent landscapes, including off-street parking for three dormitories, and clearly delineated work areas for the Forestry and Land Use Departments. The official groundbreaking was on May 4, 2013 and dedication of Sally B was on November 16, 2013.\n\n## [25\\. Leonard Field](#fs-panel-2914)\n\nProctor’s first athletic field was used by football teams for decades before it was formally dedicated to Mrs. Hazel Clark-Leonard in October, 1960. Today, Leonard Field is the home of football and boys’ junior varsity lacrosse.\n\n## [26\\. Organic Community Garden](#fs-panel-2930)\n\nStudents, faculty and friends all cooperate in this venture, growing lettuce, basil, carrots, chard, spinach, tomatoes, tomatillos, onions, garlic, mustard greens and nasturtiums. Produce from the garden augments the salad bar through the summer, and, to some extent, throughout the year (basil pesto and other herbs freeze well!). While this garden’s history is only a decade old, organic gardening is a long-standing tradition at Proctor, going back to extensive “victory gardens” in the early 1940s.\n\n## [27\\. MacKenzie House Dormitory](#fs-panel-2869)\n\nMackenzie House was a private home until the 1950s, when it was purchased to serve as a boys’ dormitory. Renovated extensively in the ‘90s, “Mac House” is now a popular dormitory for students.\n\n## [29\\. West End Dormitory](#fs-panel-2940)\n\nBuilt in the fall of 2016 after a fire destroyed Thoreau House in June of 2016, West End dorm sits adjacent to Cortland House, anchoring the west end of campus. Home to a faculty family and thirteen boarding students, the dorm’s large windows and spacious rooms provide an ideal location across the driveway from the Brown Dining Commons and the Farrell Field House.\n\n## [30\\. Brown Dining Commons](#fs-panel-2942)\n\nThe Proctor Dining Commons became the first dedicated dining facility in the school’s history in October, 2016. The ‘greenest’ building constructed on Proctor’s campus, the Dining Commons utilizes geothermal heating/cooling, state of the art insulation, and food processing equipment. The Dining Commons has stunning southerly views over Carr Field and the Proctor Ski Area.\n\n## [31\\. Fowler Learning Center](#fs-panel-2827)\n\nThe Alice and David Fowler Learning Center is the crown jewel of our academic facilities. It was dedicated in June, 1994, in honor of David Fowler’s retirement (after 30 years at Proctor, including 25 years as Head of School). This building was inspired by a Quaker barn and celebrates the legacy of both David and Alice Fowler. A stunning, open atrium on the east side connects Information Technology with the Lovejoy Library and Learning Skills. The Fowler Learning Center immediately gained national attention in architectural magazines, and was honored for its successful integration of small-town, New England style with state-of-the-art technologies.\n\n## [32\\. Farm House Dormitory](#fs-panel-2861)\n\nThe Farm House was once home to Andover’s Fenton family and was acquired by the school in the 1950s. The original barn was rebuilt to become a dormitory for seven students, while the main house is a spacious and comfortable faculty residence.\n\n## [33\\. Proctor Pond](#fs-panel-2932)\n\nA stream was dammed by a student “Improvement team” in the 1940s to create the school’s first skating rink. Boards and lights were installed in the 1950’s, as ice hockey became a major winter sport. After an indoor ice rink was installed (near the present facility,) the pond was dredged and a retaining wall was constructed on the east end. Today, Proctor Pond serves many purposes. It is a reservoir for campus irrigation systems, a home to wildlife and, once plowed, a central skating pond. Each winter, we build bonfires at the edge of the pond and play intramural broomball.\n\n## [34\\. Jaxtimer Fire Pit](#fs-panel-5629)\n\n## [35\\. Wilkins Meeting House](#fs-panel-2903)\n\n“The Meeting House” is one of the most architecturally and aesthetically beautiful facilities in central New Hampshire. Designed in the image of a Shaker barn, the Meeting House is a physical metaphor for Proctor values. Here, the whole community assembles for daily assemblies at which anyone may speak. Dance studios, a blackbox theater, costume shops, a huge stage tech facility and the Cotton Projection Room surround the 410-seat Norris Family Theater. The Meeting House brings people together, to be their best. This is what Proctor is all about. The Meeting House was opened in 2001, and was named in honor of Steve Wilkins, who was Head of School from 1994-2005, and his wife Sarah, who taught in the Learning Skills Department.\n\nIn 2013, 273 photovoltaic solar panels were installed on the roof of the Wilkins Meeting House. These panels generate more than 70,000 KW hours of renewable electricity per year. \n\n## [36\\. Recording Studio](#fs-panel-2928)\n\nThe recording studio is, in the words of the designer, “The finest teaching recording studio in the world.” While the technology inside gives students the ability to mix tracks like professionals, it is the vibration insulation that catches the attention of national media. A writer for an acoustic design magazine noted, “Each room is suspended by thousands of rubber pads against the outside wall, so that a heavy truck passing by on North Street (which would be rare) will have no discernible vibration in the performance spaces or the recording studio... No one has ever seen anything like this. And then there’s the recording technology!” In recording classes, each student designs unique mixes of music, which is displayed on a projection screen for other students to appreciate and evaluate. Visit this space when it’s in action, with jazz/rock playing in the studio, with the recording team working the state-of-the-art sound systems.\n\n## [37\\. Imagination Inn Day Care Facility](#fs-panel-2881)\n\nThis facility houses a fun, highly successful day care program for thirty children, many of whom are employee children.

Farr Cottage](#fs-panel-2849)\n\nNamed for Headmaster Theodore “Teddy” Parker Farr, Farr Cottage is a faculty residence.\n\n## [42\\. Carriage House Dormitory](#fs-panel-2847)\n\nThe cottage at the west end, now a faculty residence, housed horse-drawn carriages in the 19th Century as a part of the Proctor and Carr Family estate. A new dormitory, built to exacting environmental standards, was completed in 1998. A classroom separates the east wing from the west wing. For decades, Carriage House served as an Environmental themed dormitory, and in 2022 became the school's first all-gender dorm. Students in Carriage House live with intentionality as they craft their dorm community. \n\n## [43\\. Carr House Dormitory](#fs-panel-2845)\n\nThis charming, Greek-revival colonial was built by John Proctor in the 1870s, and was renovated by the Carr family eighty years ago.

The building retains many charming accents from its history as a grand home: dentil trim and fine molding, bull’s eye glass, rare patio tiles, and linen closets in a maid’s apartment. The original living room now serves as the dorm’s common space, located across the front hall from the faculty apartment.\n\n## [44\\. Rulon-Miller Dormitory](#fs-panel-2843)\n\nThe front “Cape” of this facility was a local residence from 1848 until 1980, when it was purchased by the school. At that time, the old barn that was attached to the back was moved across campus to become the Robert Wilson Forestry Building, and a new two-story dormitory, housing 12 students, was built in its place. The original, front cape serves as the faculty apartment. This dorm is named for an active alumnus from the Class of 1957, who served as a Trustee from 1970 until his passing in 2011.\n\n## [45\\. Ives House Dormitory](#fs-panel-2841)\n\nNamed for Henry C. Ives, a scholarly instructor who served as Head of School in 1904, this dormitory is popular for its central location and architectural charm. It has a home-like feel, and the 12 students who live in Ives enjoy spacious rooms and a short walk to most classes.\n\n## [46\\. Shirley Hall](#fs-panel-2825)\n\nShirley Hall was completed in 1962, and was one of several significant construction projects completed during Lyle Farrell’s tenure. He served as Head of School from 1952 to 1971, and was proud to promote physical improvements to campus, referring to himself as “The Great Builder.” The building was named for William R. Shirley, class of 1916, who drew the architectural lines and donated to the project.

In 1994, Shirley was significantly remodeled, and now the Science Department is on the top floor, with the Mathematics Department downstairs.\n\n## [47\\. Slocumb Hall](#fs-panel-2879)\n\nThis charming building was constructed in the 1870s as a livery stable (for the horses that drew carriages from the railroad station to the Proctor House Hotel). It was extensively renovated one hundred years ago by H. Langford Warren, Dean of the Architecture School at Harvard University. After the renovation, it was used as Proctor’s gymnasium for the better part of the 20th century, with shower rooms on the north side. Slocumb was improved in 2009 with new insulation, windows, and added space, and is now home to studio art, ceramics, and a photography darkroom.\n\n## [48\\. Alan Shepard Boat House](#fs-panel-2883)\n\nBoat building has a long, colorful history at Proctor. Since the 1930s, hundreds of rowboats, sailing dinghies, canoes and kayaks have been built here. If you’re curious about what it takes to build a boat, here’s what one alum had to say.\n\nWhen Alan Shepard was a boy– long before he became America’s first astronaut in space-– he spent a summer building a boat at Proctor. In 1961, when Shepard became a national hero, we named the old shop in his honor!\n\nToday, the top floor is still home to woodshop and boat building classes. Downstairs, metal engineering, blacksmithing, and jewelry classes meet.\n\n## [49\\. The Walt Wright ‘48 Biomass Plant](#fs-panel-2909)\n\nThe Walt Wright ‘48 Biomass Plant was built in 2008, transforming Proctor’s 50 year old oil powered central steam plant into an energy efficient, biomass plant powered by local wood chips harvested off of Proctor's land. The plant has reduced Proctor’s heating oil consumption by more than 75% each year, connecting all major buildings throughout campus and allowing Proctor to live out its environmental mission statement.  \n\n## [50\\. Newell Service Building](#fs-panel-2823)\n\n**Business Office / HR / Maintenance / Housekeeping**\n\nThe Newell Service Building, known jokingly as “the Garage Majal,” is a high-tech facility for Proctor’s many service vehicles, including bio-diesel trucks, gators and tractors. The top floor is home to the Business Office, Human Resources, Maintenance, and Housekeeping.\n\n## [51\\. Maxwell Savage Hall / Wise Community Center](#fs-panel-2821)\n\nMaxwell Savage was completed in 1932 after the first Academic Building was destroyed by fire in 1931. It is the most prominent and recognizable building on campus. Named for a well-known Unitarian minister, Maxwell Savage is the main administrative building, while also serving as home to the world language department, the student mail room, and the bookstore. The bell atop Maxwell, as the students call it, rings to call the school together for morning assemblies and to celebrate team road victories. The back addition, built in 1958, is home to the English Department and connects to the Wise community center.\n\nThe Wise Center space was original constructed as Holland Auditorium in 1958, where it was home to all-school assemblies and Proctor Drama until the Norris Family Theater opened in the Meeting House in 2001. Through the generosity of a generous alumni and trustees, this space was completely rebuilt as the Ruby and Bill Wise ‘39 Community Center. Known on campus simply as “The Wise,” this is the place where students go to relax with friends, grab a bite to eat from the grill, or play pool and ping pong in the evenings.\n\n## [52\\. Stone Chapel](#fs-panel-2877)\n\nThe Stone Chapel, a historic Tudor built in 1910, serves many purposes for the Proctor and Andover community. It was completely rebuilt in 2005, and served as home to the school’s  popular voice and chorus programs throughout the first two decades of the 2000s. The sanctuary of the original chapel serves as both a practice and performance space. Downstairs are practice rooms, where sopranos, tenors, baritones and bass singers practice in soundproofed spaces. On Sundays, the Chapel is used by the community as a Unitarian Church.\n\n## [53\\.

The Barn](#fs-panel-2885)\n\nOriginally constructed in Center Harbor, New Hampshire, the barn was disassembled piece-by-piece and rebuilt at the east end of the central campus as part of a Fall Family Weekend project in 1974. Today, it is the occasional home to faculty livestock. \n\n## [56\\. Carr Field](#fs-panel-2893)\n\nSituated immediately across the road from four dormitories, Carr Field offers three playing fields for soccer and lacrosse teams, as well as a new baseball diamond installed in 2013. Originally pasture land, Carr Field was graded in 1979 and is fully irrigated with water from the Blackwater River, which flows below its southern bluff. The field is named in honor of the Carr Family, who supported the school throughout the early 1900s and sold their extensive land holdings to the school in the late 1960s.\n\n## [57\\. The Head’s House](#fs-panel-2833)\n\nAcquired by the school in 1994 to serve as the residence for the Head of School and family, this building was originally built for John Proctor’s brother, William, in the 1870s.

He coaches local kids, many of whom come to Proctor to further their careers as national and international qualifiers. 30- and 15-meter jumps benefit from top-to-bottom snow-making and lighting, making this facility the finest in New Hampshire.\n\n## [60\\. Yarrow’s Lodge](#fs-panel-2891)\n\nYarrow’s Lodge has two stories of wood-heated space for relaxing, changing in and out of ski gear, a quick meal, and entertainment. Downstairs is all business. Upstairs, you can relax with views of the race course, purchase burgers and shakes, or step out on the immense south-facing deck, where a grill serves up more delicacies. Yarrow’s Lodge is a campus social center from December to March.\n\n## [61\\. Community House](#fs-panel-2944)\n\nFormerly the Blackwater Ski Shop, an iconic small town ski shop, the Proctor Community House is now home to the student-run Proctor Coffee House and Community program.

Proctor Block](#fs-panel-2819)\n\n**Admissions / Development & Alumni / Communications**\n\nOnce the village’s most prominent building, the Proctor Block was built in the 1870s as a municipal facility. John Proctor, a local tycoon, financed its construction as part of an extensive town improvement project.. It once had a third floor, but it was destroyed by fire a century ago. Over the years, different parts of the Proctor Block have served as a town hall, a U.S. post office and even a hamburger joint! Proctor purchased it 1983,  and it was renovated for history classrooms (upstairs) and  Admissions and Development offices downstairs. Today, Admissions occupies the entire first floor, and Communications and Development operate out of the upper level.\n\n## [64\\.

  "text": "To the Proctor Community:\nWe have a distinct advantage of being a school that knows itself well. With that comes an obligation to be ever mindful of the School’s future direction and purpose. Proctor’s role in the independent school world comes from that unambiguous self-knowledge while ensuring that we are always putting good and sound ideas into practice. In this, our 175th year, we mark this important time in the evolution of our journey to focus even further on the people, program, and ideas that will carry us into our next chapter.\nOver the last two years, Proctor’s Board of Trustees and community embarked upon Strategic Visioning and Planning processes that surveyed and called together constituencies from around the globe to understand our immovables as a unique learning and living community.\nWe affirmed our unique educational model that is undergirded by Learning Skills, experiential education, and the deep abiding focus on human relationships at the center of it all. These priorities sit at the core of our Strategic Plan moving forward: Engagement and Human Relationships, a Unified Language and Model for Learning, and Supporting and Sustaining Proctor.\nThe focus now is to get crystal clear on these priorities in the goals we have set while working towards an even brighter future for the next two centuries. Strategic Plans, just like good and great music, work well when there are notes to play within the framework of a strong score and good orderly direction.

With that comes an obligation to be ever mindful of the School’s future direction and purpose. Proctor’s role in the independent school world comes from that unambiguous self-knowledge while ensuring that we are always putting good and sound ideas into practice. In this, our 175th year, we mark this important time in the evolution of our journey to focus even further on the people, program, and ideas that will carry us into our next chapter.\n\nOver the last two years, Proctor’s Board of Trustees and community  embarked upon Strategic Visioning and Planning processes that surveyed and called together constituencies from around the globe to understand our immovables as a unique learning and living community.\n\nWe affirmed our unique educational model that is undergirded by Learning Skills, experiential education, and the deep abiding focus on human relationships at the center of it all. These priorities sit at the core of our Strategic Plan moving forward: Engagement and Human Relationships, a Unified Language and Model for Learning, and Supporting and Sustaining Proctor.\n\nThe focus now is to get crystal clear on these priorities in the goals we have set while working towards an even brighter future for the next two centuries. Strategic Plans, just like good and great music, work well when there are notes to play within the framework of a strong score and good orderly direction.

  "text": "Proctor’s academic curriculum is rooted in the belief that academic challenge, overt support systems, and a preference for hands-on, experiential modes of teaching creates enduring learning for students.\nWhile at most schools the individual must conform to a set of systems, at Proctor the school grows around each student’s academic interests. \nGraduation Requirements \nEnglish\t12 Credits\t\nMathematics\t9 Credits \t\nScience\t9 Credits \t\nHistory\t8 Credits\t\nWorld Language\t6 Credits \t\nArt\t3 Credits \t\nProgramming\t1 Credit \t\nWeaving a Web of Support\nIntegrated Support \nProctor’s integrated academic support program weaves a web of support around each student.\nWhether it is through our Learning Skills Program, peer-tutoring in math and writing, extra help sessions with teachers each evening, or the advisor system, students learn to advocate for themselves and their own learning.\nLearn more about academic support at Proctor here. \nOfficial Notes and Communication\nAt Proctor, the web of structure and support extends beyond individual relationships to the methods of communication within a student’s team of adults. Through our Official Notes system, electronic feedback is regularly sent to students' support teams, including the students themselves, parents, advisors, Learning Specialist, coaches, and dorm parents. These Official Notes are not negative, but rather constructive in nature and can serve as the impetus for face-to-face communication between student and advisor about academic performance, behavior, or community engagement.\nAcademic Concentrations Program\nAcademic Concentrations lie at the intersection of intellectual curiosity and academic rigor. By empowering self-directed students to design an individualized program of coursework, experiential learning beyond campus, and a culminating capstone, Concentrations assist intellectual development on a sophisticated level. Learn more! \nEngagement - the “WHY”\nProctor teachers help recruit interest, sustain effort and persistence, and encourage self-regulation in students..

Through our Official Notes system, electronic feedback is regularly sent to students' support teams, including the students themselves, parents, advisors, Learning Specialist, coaches, and dorm parents. These Official Notes are not negative, but rather constructive in nature and can serve as the impetus for face-to-face communication between student and advisor about academic performance, behavior, or community engagement.\n\n![Academic Concentrations ](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1676907428/proctoracademyorg/l1hgseq2tyxstdranqon/academic_concentrations.jpg)\n\n## Academic Concentrations Program\n\nAcademic Concentrations lie at the intersection of intellectual curiosity and academic rigor.

  "text": "Athlete Performance: Athletic Training and Strength & Conditioning\nProctor’s Athletic Training staff and Strength and Conditioning coaches work to provide Proctor’s student athletes with comprehensive injury prevention, strength, conditioning, and treatment services comparable to most college athletic departments. With three full time athletic trainers and two part time strength and conditioning coaches, all students have the opportunity to optimize their performance on the fields, trails, courts, ice, and snow.\nWho are Athletic Trainers? \nConcussion Information \nAthletic Training Techniques at Proctor \nWho are Athletic Trainers?\nAthletic training encompasses the prevention, examination, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of emergent, acute or chronic injuries and medical conditions. Athletic training is recognized by the American Medical Association (AMA), Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as an allied health care profession.\nAthletic trainers (ATs) are highly qualified, multi-skilled health care professionals who render service or treatment, under the direction of or in collaboration with a physician, in accordance with their education, training and the state's statutes, rules and regulations. Athletic trainers provide medical services to all types of patients, not just athletes participating in sports, and can work in a variety of job settings.\nAs a part of the health care team, services provided by athletic trainers include primary care, injury and illness prevention, wellness promotion and education, emergent care, examination and clinical diagnosis, therapeutic intervention and rehabilitation of injuries and medical conditions. \nAthletic trainers improve functional outcomes and specialize in patient education to prevent injury and re-injury. Preventative care provided by an athletic trainer helps to reduce injury and shorten rehabilitation time for patients. \nAthletic trainers are sometimes confused with personal trainers. There is, however, a large difference in the education, skillset, job duties and patients of an athletic trainer and a personal trainer. The athletic training academic curriculum and clinical training follows the medical model. Find out more information HERE. \nConcussion Information\nProctor Academy utilizes a multifaceted, cutting edge approach to ensure any concussed student receives the treatment they need in an individualized manner. \n\nNeurocognitive Testing:\nWe subscribe to ImPACT Applications and have every student take a Baseline Test to establish pre-injury norms. In the event of a suspected concussion, a student is retested to help determine if a concussion diagnosis makes sense and then again to help gauge recovery. In the recent past, as part of our partnership with Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center’s Neuropsychology unit and The Brain Injury Association of New Hampshire, we have been able to provide baseline and post-injury testing free of charge to students.\nIn 2019, The Brain Injury Association of New Hampshire is unable to provide funding for ImPACT tests. As a result, Proctor is implementing a fee structure for post-injury ImPACT tests. Tests will be charged to a students’ account if they are treated for a concussion. Most students who incur a concussion take three post-injury tests. Each test costs $7, resulting in a $21 total charge. \nProctor will continue to provide baseline ImPACT tests as well as Return to Learn and Return to Play support at no charge. Additionally, post-injury tests will continue to be interpreted by Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center’s Neuropsychology unit at no charge to students. \nA multi step approach to care:\nReturn to Learn:\nOnce placed in the concussion protocol, care is taken to monitor a student’s symptoms daily and when appropriate, to get feedback from a student’s teachers. Students are generally excused from homework during the recovery time, including all assessments. As a student recovers they slowly take on academic burdens ending with the taking of assessments. All assessments are eventually made up after recovery while most of the missed daily homework is exempt. \nReturn to Play:\nOnce a student returns to normal affect, they begin a multi day return to play protocol. A student will initially begin with a few days of cardiovascular workouts and then increase to sport specific activities. Once cleared by a Doctor, Neurologist (both can be supplied by Proctor), a Parent and the Athletic Training staff, the student is allowed to begin team practices, beginning with non-contact one day, full-contact the next and finally ending with game clearance.\nAthletic Training Techniques at Proctor\nProctor's athletic trainers use a variety of techniques to treat, prevent, and rehabilitate athletic injuries. Learn more below.\nInstrument-assisted soft-tissue mobilization (or IASTM for short) is one of a number of our manual therapy approaches that uses specialized instruments to massage or “scrape” the skin gently. This is done to release adhesions in the fascia (connective tissue), increase localized blood flow, and aid in the healing process of tendons, ligaments, and scars. All of the Proctor Academy Athletic Training staff has been certified in this technique. In addition to the healing benefits mentioned above, we want to let you know that some IASTM massage may have slight bruising associated with it. Like many manual therapies, it may also cause soreness the following day. These side effects usually resolve in one to two days after treatment. Learn more HERE.\nIn addition to this, cupping has been added to the list of potential treatment options our AT staff can provide. Cupping has been used as a healing modality for thousands of years across different cultures, spanning multiple continents. While it comes in a variety of forms, generally speaking, cupping is the use of suction on the body to produce therapeutic effects. At Proctor, the AT staff has been trained in the use of silicone and plastic cups to treat musculoskeletal injuries and pain via the separation, hydration and encouragement of fluid exchange in the body's tissues. As with IASTM, a cupping treatment may leave marks on the body that resemble bruises. While these marks have the potential to appear quite significant, they are completely benign and, unlike in other manual therapies, should not be sore or tender. Our cupping does not involve the breaking of skin or the use of fire as in other forms and is completely safe.

Cupping has been used as a healing modality for thousands of years across different cultures, spanning multiple continents. While it comes in a variety of forms, generally speaking, cupping is the use of suction on the body to produce therapeutic effects. At Proctor, the AT staff has been trained in the use of silicone and plastic cups to treat musculoskeletal injuries and pain via the separation, hydration and encouragement of fluid exchange in the body's tissues. As with IASTM, a cupping treatment may leave marks on the body that resemble bruises. While these marks have the potential to appear quite significant, they are completely benign and, unlike in other manual therapies, should not be sore or tender. Our cupping does not involve the breaking of skin or the use of fire as in other forms and is completely safe. Learn more [HERE](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Cupping_Therapy).\n\n  **Other modalities provided:**\n\n*   Ice \n*   Electric Stimulation\n*   Heat\n*   Ultrasound\n*   Laser\n*   Cold whirlpool\n*   Game Ready"

  "text": "Each trimester, students must engage in Proctor’s afternoon program. If students are not engaged with an athletic team, they can take part in one of Proctor’s extensive afternoon activity offerings. These offerings allow students to explore and develop skills and competencies in a variety of disciplines. Proctor’s commitment to creativity, outdoor experiences, learning new skills, and empowering students to pursue passions is reflected in its afternoon program. \nBand and Recording \nCommunity Service/Fitness \nDevelopmental Skiing and Snowboarding \nEquestrian and Horsemanship \nForestry Research Crew \nKayaking \nRobotics \nRock Climbing \nSki Patrol \nTheater and Drama Tech \nWoods Team \nBand and Recording\nBand and Recording places each student in the role of record producer. Utilizing state-of-the-art Pro Tools HD and LE, as well as industry standard Digidesign 24-channel D-Command surface, you will develop all the skills of music production. Learn the criteria for choosing members of an ensemble, the material they wish to develop, and the decorum necessary for effective and efficient rehearsals, performances and recording sessions. By the end of term, you may participate in on or off campus performances or produce digital recordings.\nCommunity Service/Fitness\nCommunity Service is a volunteer outreach program to benefit Proctor and the local community. Students rake leaves, press apples for cider, tend the organic garden, rake snow from neighbors' roofs, stack wood, collect recyclable materials from dormitories, contribute to the town’s after school program, tend Proctor’s wood-fired sauna and serve at on-campus athletic events. For additional physical training and health, students train in the Fitness Center and practice beginner yoga.\nDevelopmental Skiing and Snowboarding\nRecreational Skiing and Snowboarding engages those students looking to ski or ride in a non-competitive environment. Students of all abilities have the opportunity to ski Monday through Saturday at Ragged Mountain or the Proctor Ski Area. Emphasis is placed on recreational enjoyment at the sport while providing skill building activities. Value is placed on skiing as a life-long sport. The Recreational Skiing and Snowboarding program encourages safety, courtesy, and a love for snow.\nEquestrian and Horsemanship \nLocated just a few short miles from campus on the shores of beautiful Bradley Lake, Seery Hill Stables is home to Proctor’s equestrian program. All levels of riding experience are welcome! A typical week includes four days of instruction (hunt seat) and a workday at the barn. Seery Hill has an indoor arena, heated tack room, outdoor arena, and plenty of turnout. Proctor riders compete successfully through the New Hampshire High School Equestrian Teams organization in hunter suitability, dressage and equitation. Seery Hill offers seventeen beautiful horses to ride, and students can arrange to board their own horses.\nProctor's Fall and Spring Horsemanship activity is run out of Whisper Wind Stable in nearby East Andover, New Hampshire. This program is holistic in nature with a balance of experiences that include hunt seat and western riding, driving, trail riding, training, and all-around horse-keeping skills. In the fall and spring, the group does competitive trail rides, hunter/pace competitions, and Regional 4H horses in both English and Western Pleasure, and over fences. \nForestry Research Crew\nThe Proctor Forest Research Crew is a new afternoon activity with the goal of setting up the Proctor Woodlands for ecological research. Students will learn forest measurement skills and collect data at each of the 150 permanent plots in the Proctor experimental plot grid. We will hike out to all corners of the Proctor forest and serve this community by establishing a long-term dataset that will inform our forest management. Students will learn many field skills including tree identification, mapping, compass use, tree measurement, data collection, and invasive species identification/removal. The Forest Research Crew will partner with Woods Team approximately once a week, allowing students to be involved in other forest projects including trail work and pressing apple cider.\nThis afternoon activity will count as an active activity credit as well as a community service credit. Students who choose to participate in both the afternoon activity AND the course Forest Ecology Research Design will also receive science academic credit for the afternoon activity.\nKayaking\nFall Kayaking at Proctor welcomes all levels of ability (the spring team is a competitive sport). Students learn river safety and how to navigate a river safely. While the sport of kayaking is highly individual, running the river is done as a team and requires excellent teamwork for the safety of all involved. Proctor is nestled on the Blackwater River that flows between Mount Kearsarge and Ragged Mountain--our location for paddling rivers is excellent. The team starts on beautiful Elbow Pond. By the end of the fall, the group paddles the Pemigewasset River, Sumner Falls on the Connecticut River, the Androscoggin River, and surf the waves of the Atlantic Ocean. If you enjoy getting wet in the water and the beauty of nature, try kayaking. We have a lot of fun learning how to paddle, eskimo roll, and surf endless river waves.\nRobotics\nProctor's Robotics team became an afternoon activity in 2016 after student interest inspired more dedicated time to engineering, design, and experimentation associated with a robotic program. Students and their faculty leader compete in regional and national robotics competitions.\nRock Climbing\nA high-tech, indoor climbing wall in the Mike Henriques and Betsy Paine Outdoor Center provides an on-campus location for Proctor rock climbing. The rock-climbing team also takes full advantage of the opportunity to execute bouldering routes on the Stone Chapel! But that’s just the start. Newbury Cliffs, Rumney and Cathedral Ledges all beckon for afternoons on belay. If the team gets an early afternoon start, it’s fun to descend from the top of The Bulkhead, the granite cliff on the east shoulder of Ragged Mountain, on the northeast corner of Proctor’s 2,500 property.\nSki Patrol \nSki Patrol trains students to be certified as National Ski Patrol professionals while operating all aspects of our Proctor Ski Area. Ski Patrollers learn rapid response techniques for all types of ski accidents and injuries. Immobilization, splinting and emergency evacuation are practiced with EMTs from local rescue squads. In addition, students manage the rope tow and T-bar lifts, snowmaking and assist with the operation of Yarrow’s Lodge. Finally, they patrol all slopes before closing down at night. In addition to hosting daily ski training for Proctor and area school groups, The Blackwater is the site of dozens of school, USSA and FISA events each winter. Proctor Ski Patrol is serious, professional, and fun!\nTheater and Drama Tech\nTheater and Theater Tech is an umbrella term covering a diverse set of theater activities including directing, Children’s Theater, acting and tech support. Whether your passion is acting, directing, sound engineering, lighting, set design or other aspects of drama tech, Theater offers limitless opportunities for skill advancement, hard work and fun.\nWoods Team\nProctor is fortunate to own and steward over 2,500 acres of woodlands. The woods team cares for this expansive forest. Gathering after classes at the Woodlands Center, they hop in the back of a pickup truck for a bumpy ride over woodland trails to clear new trails, repair bridges, clean up logging sites and identify trees for selective cutting. They split logs for wood-burning furnaces in dormitories, and deliver that cordwood to those dorms. In March, their focus turns to tapping the school’s 300-plus maple trees, gathering sap and—best of all—boiling the sap into maple syrup in the sugarhouse. The woods team is a hearty crowd who love working outdoors on diverse tasks related to forestry and silviculture.",

In the fall and spring, the group does competitive trail rides, hunter/pace competitions, and Regional 4H horses in both English and Western Pleasure, and over fences. \n\n## [Forestry Research Crew](#fs-panel-3234)\n\n![Forestry](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1680275451/proctoracademyorg/k8gyroe9v8nohpzlotyq/forestry.jpg)\n\nThe Proctor Forest Research Crew is a new afternoon activity with the goal of setting up the Proctor Woodlands for ecological research. Students will learn forest measurement skills and collect data at each of the 150 permanent plots in the Proctor experimental plot grid. We will hike out to all corners of the Proctor forest and serve this community by establishing a long-term dataset that will inform our forest management. Students will learn many field skills including tree identification, mapping, compass use, tree measurement, data collection, and invasive species identification/removal. The Forest Research Crew will partner with Woods Team approximately once a week, allowing students to be involved in other forest projects including trail work and pressing apple cider.\n\n  This afternoon activity will count as an active activity credit as well as a community service credit. Students who choose to participate in both the afternoon activity AND the course Forest Ecology Research Design will also receive science academic credit for the afternoon activity.\n\n## [Kayaking](#fs-panel-3236)\n\n![kayaking](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1680275553/proctoracademyorg/grjdbxa3rrof2e6hmqyx/kayaking.jpg)\n\nFall Kayaking at Proctor welcomes all levels of ability (the spring team is a competitive sport). Students learn river safety and how to navigate a river safely. While the sport of kayaking is highly individual, running the river is done as a team and requires excellent teamwork for the safety of all involved. Proctor is nestled on the Blackwater River that flows between Mount Kearsarge and Ragged Mountain--our location for paddling rivers is excellent. The team starts on beautiful Elbow Pond. By the end of the fall, the group paddles the Pemigewasset River, Sumner Falls on the Connecticut River, the Androscoggin River, and surf the waves of the Atlantic Ocean. If you enjoy getting wet in the water and the beauty of nature, try kayaking. We have a lot of fun learning how to paddle, eskimo roll, and surf endless river waves.\n\n## [Robotics](#fs-panel-3238)\n\n![Robotics](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1680275638/proctoracademyorg/ydjnsqg4frbmennzcxwf/robotics2.jpg)\n\nProctor's Robotics team became an afternoon activity in 2016 after student interest inspired more dedicated time to engineering, design, and experimentation associated with a robotic program. Students and their faculty leader compete in regional and national robotics competitions.\n\n## [Rock Climbing](#fs-panel-3240)\n\n![Rock climbing](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1680275727/proctoracademyorg/ixeg3foybtn3w7yjhbqd/rockclimbing.jpg)\n\nA high-tech, indoor climbing wall in the Mike Henriques and Betsy Paine Outdoor Center provides an on-campus location for Proctor rock climbing. The rock-climbing team also takes full advantage of the opportunity to execute bouldering routes on the Stone Chapel! But that’s just the start. Newbury Cliffs, Rumney and Cathedral Ledges all beckon for afternoons on belay. If the team gets an early afternoon start, it’s fun to descend from the top of The Bulkhead, the granite cliff on the east shoulder of Ragged Mountain, on the northeast corner of Proctor’s 2,500 property.\n\n## [Ski Patrol](#fs-panel-3242)\n\n![Ski Patrol](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1680275810/proctoracademyorg/zmi7xreinyme0kxu5xwf/skipatrol.jpg)\n\nSki Patrol trains students to be certified as National Ski Patrol professionals while operating all aspects of our Proctor Ski Area. Ski Patrollers learn rapid response techniques for all types of ski accidents and injuries. Immobilization, splinting and emergency evacuation are practiced with EMTs from local rescue squads. In addition, students manage the rope tow and T-bar lifts, snowmaking and assist with the operation of Yarrow’s Lodge. Finally, they patrol all slopes before closing down at night. In addition to hosting daily ski training for Proctor and area school groups, The Blackwater is the site of dozens of school, USSA and FISA events each winter. Proctor Ski Patrol is serious, professional, and fun!\n\n## [Theater and Drama Tech](#fs-panel-3244)\n\n![Drama Tech](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1680275919/proctoracademyorg/ttj1mmowdeifunakyqcc/drama_tech.jpg)\n\nTheater and Theater Tech is an umbrella term covering a diverse set of theater activities including directing, Children’s Theater, acting and tech support. Whether your passion is acting, directing, sound engineering, lighting, set design or other aspects of drama tech, Theater offers limitless opportunities for skill advancement, hard work and fun.\n\n## [Woods Team](#fs-panel-3246)\n\n![Woods Team](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1676922196/proctoracademyorg/pvhpsndvcvmdck23bdf9/woods_team.jpg)\n\nProctor is fortunate to own and steward over 2,500 acres of woodlands. The woods team cares for this expansive forest. Gathering after classes at the Woodlands Center, they hop in the back of a pickup truck for a bumpy ride over woodland trails to clear new trails, repair bridges, clean up logging sites and identify trees for selective cutting. They split logs for wood-burning furnaces in dormitories, and deliver that cordwood to those dorms. In March, their focus turns to tapping the school’s 300-plus maple trees, gathering sap and—best of all—boiling the sap into maple syrup in the sugarhouse. The woods team is a hearty crowd who love working outdoors on diverse tasks related to forestry and silviculture."

  "text": "The Dunbar Legacy Society is named in honor of James L. Dunbar (1929-2020), a 1949 graduate of Proctor Academy. Growing up with the misdiagnosed and misunderstood disability of dyslexia was incredibly difficult for a child in the 1930s and 1940s. At Proctor, Jim made friends and found teachers who cared about his well-being and academic growth. In those years at Proctor, his academic growth was mirrored by growing self-confidence and positive attitude, and it was that positive attitude that became the key ingredient to his success in the years to come. After graduation from Proctor, Jim studied in college, and in 1956 launched his own company, Dunbar Armored, the largest independently owned company of its type in the United States until being acquired by the Brinks Co. in 2018.\nThe Dunbar Society was established to recognize all those who have made a provision for Proctor Academy through a bequest, trust, insurance or retirement policy, or other estate-planning vehicle. Jim was a visionary advocate for the advancement of Proctor and its programs. In addition to extraordinary annual and capital support that spanned decades, he made a generous gift to Proctor through a bequest. Making a planned gift is a wonderful way to show your support and appreciation for Proctor.\nIt is a privilege to recognize alumni, parents, and friends who share in Jim’s vision for Proctor, and have included the school in their future philanthropy. \nTo Learn More About Planned Giving:\nFor more information on making a planned gift, or to join The James L. Dunbar '49 Legacy Society, please contact: \nTracey Perkins\n(603) 735-6723 or perkinstr@proctoracademy.org.\nProctor Academy Development Office\nP.O. Box 389\nAndover, NH 03216\nFAX: (603) 735-6305\nOur Tax ID#\n501 C3, 02-0222179\nWAYS TO GIVE\nGifts by Will \nGifts That Pay You Income \nGifts That Protect Your Assets \nGifts from Retirement Plans \nGifts by Estate Note \nGifts by Will\nYou may prefer to state in your will or trust a sum of money or a percentage of your estate that you wish to give to Proctor Academy \nMaking a gift through a bequest, it is not subject to federal estate taxes and so significantly reduces the tax burden of an estate. The value of the bequest may be deducted when the taxable estate is determined, and there is no limit to the deduction.\nThe following sample wording for an outright bequest to Proctor can be given to your legal counsel:\nUnrestricted Bequest\n“I bequeath to Proctor Academy, Tax ID# 02-0222179 204 Main Street, Andover NH 03216, the sum of $_______ (or percent of my residuary estate); (or an accurate description of securities, real estate, or other property given) to be used for the School’s general purposes.”\nRestricted Bequest\n“I bequeath to Proctor Academy, Tax ID# 02-0222179 204 Main Street, Andover NH 03216,, the sum of $_______ (or percent of my residuary estate); (or an accurate description of securities, real estate, or other property given). This gift shall be used for (here describe in broad, general terms the desired purpose).”\nGifts That Pay You Income\nDo you want to support Proctor Academy but worry about having enough income for yourself and your loved ones? Life-income gifts such as gift annuities and charitable remainder trusts can provide donors with an income stream, significant tax savings, and the satisfaction of providing Proctor with vital long-term resources.\nThe creation of a life-income gift benefits both the giver and the receiver—a \"win-win\" situation.\nGifts That Protect Your Assets\nThis type of gift arrangement allows you to direct gifts to Proctor for a specified period of time and, in turn, receive either a charitable deduction now for gifts made in subsequent years or a reduction in gift or estate taxes on property you wish to pass to heirs.\nUnder the non grantor plan, you irrevocably transfer assets to a trustee and provide that payments be made to Proctor for a certain number of years (or until the end of your or another's life). Then the principal is distributed to your children, grandchildren, or other heirs. The principal passes to your heirs at greatly reduced gift- and estate-tax rates and sometimes escapes them altogether. The charitable lead trust may appeal to individuals who wish to make a gift but retain the property in their family.\nCharitable lead trusts (CLTs) are simple in concept but are complex gift- and estate-planning devices because of the many technical drafting requirements of the IRS. We recommend you consult an attorney who specializes in trusts and estates and has experience with CLTs.\nGifts from Retirement Plans\nYour retirement-plan benefits are very likely a significant portion of your net worth. And because of special tax considerations, they could make an excellent choice for funding a charitable gift.\nRetirement-plan benefits include assets held in individual retirement accounts (IRAs), 401(k) plans, profit-sharing plans, Keogh plans, and 403(b) plans.\nGifts by Estate Note\nAn estate note is an irrevocable pledge or debt against the donor's estate. This instrument binds the donor's estate to the extent not paid during the donor's lifetime. Estate notes may be pledged for either one or two lives. With a two-life estate note, the obligation is binding only on the estate of the person who lives longer.\nProctor Alumni in the James L. Dunbar Society\nMembers of The James L.

At the same time, I take immense satisfaction knowing that I am giving in return for the many blessings my family and I have received from Proctor. Your love for this school will perpetuate the Proctor experience for generations of young people—many of whom will benefit from the school’s extraordinary support programs.

At the same time, I take immense satisfaction knowing that I am giving in return for the many blessings my family and I have received from Proctor. Your love for this school will perpetuate the Proctor experience for generations of young people—many of whom will benefit from the school’s extraordinary support programs. My dream for success came true. Together, we can make countless dreams come true.” - James L. Dunbar ‘49"

Times have changed, and so has research on the benefits of teenagers and their parents having appropriate boundaries. \nAs boarding school educators, we see real value in students learning to live and learn independently from their parents as they navigate roommate conflict, independence around meals, homework, laundry, and academic work. In fact, up until a few years ago we would kick off our new parent orientation with images and explanations of different “types” of parents - the helicopter parent, bulldozer parent, drone parent, etc. - in hopes of naming the inevitable challenges that we saw each year as parenting styles and teaching philosophies intersected. \nOur intent in identifying the potential challenges of the helicopter parent was rooted in our belief that over-parenting inhibited the development of independence core to boarding schools. New research shared in THIS ARTICLE challenges this stance to a degree as researchers have found a significant increase in the happiness of adolescents with regard to their relationship with their parents. The article notes, “Nine in 10 parents rate their relationships with their young adult children as good or excellent, and so do eight in 10 young adults, and this is consistent across income. Rather than feeling worried or disappointed about how things are going in their children’s lives, eight in 10 parents say they feel proud and hopeful.” \nIn a newscycle so often focused on how this generation of youth are struggling with mental health, substance, and overall well-being, it is refreshing to read a different narrative about the amazing young people we see walking around our campus each day. Yes, our students today may be more reliant on their parents for daily conversations, advice, and guidance, but is that a bad thing if parents are appropriately supporting their children? \nThe article discusses the evolution in societal expectations of parents and children over the past fifty years, “When baby boomers were growing up, there was a belief, rooted in the American ideal of self-sufficiency, that children should be independent after age 18. But that was in some ways an aberration, social scientists said. Before then, and again now, it has been common for members of different generations to be more interdependent.” \nJust as this interdependence among generations can be positive for young people, our interdependence with our Proctor parents is critical to the effective delivery of our mission. We seek to keep open dialogue with parents as advisors, teachers, coaches, and dorm parents, and we must, as an institution, do the same. We are partners in raising our students, and the success of our students is only possible when our work is in concert with the support and guidance of parents. If we can provide candid, regular updates with parents from our position as educators, share resources on the challenges adolescents face with our parents, and try to open the whole of the Proctor experience to our parents without compromising the growth of our students, we will ultimately help our students thrive. \nLike any complex human relationship, our relationship with our students and parents will remain a work in progress. We will make mistakes, identify areas to do better, and, hopefully, share plenty of hugs with parents in mutual appreciation for the other as we see our interdependent work play out in the graduating of good, honest, kind humans. \nStep foot into the Proctor experience on Instagram!",

  "text": "What does it mean to belong? Belong to what? Belong to whom? Over the last few years these have been a few of the questions that we have been asking ourselves on our 2500 acres about the nature of belonging, particularly around Proctor’s work in DEI-B (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging). Yet there is even a deeper rung that we reach for or even deeper in its commitment, which is to accept each other as we are. Perhaps that is the “Platinum Standard” we all seek, the act of accepting another human being as THEY want to be accepted for who they are. \nListen to Brian read his blog here!\nBecause we hail from so many different places at Proctor, both our adults and our students, the fact that we all coexist at all is more than an act of courage. We are intentional in our efforts to make sure that students and adults who live in and tend to this place we love feel as if they belong and that they matter. That means opening up a seat next to someone in the Dining Commons or making sure that we have, when we can, a no cut policy on the lower levels of our teams. It’s a hard commitment to make because it means our programs are voluminous.\nYet, even in the best of circumstances, we sometimes fall short. We are quick to point to the slight and even the pain caused because that is where our emotional connection resides. Indeed, belonging is so difficult because it is a standard that we each set for ourselves. Perhaps a better standard would be to ask what act or acts would make us feel like we are accepted, which may be something that we can practice and do. I think of many aspects of our school when I think of belonging and acceptance. Let me name just a few. \nEvery day at lunch during the work week, the housekeeping, dining, and facilities staff gather together to eat and talk about their day, which is in progress. In the restaurant business they would be called “family meals.” At these gatherings, usually just a break in a long day that begins before most of us are even awake, each group will get together at lunch to catch up, talk about their work or their own families, perhaps they will discuss the challenges they face, and even talk about about each other, in a gentle ribbing kind of way. From a distance that gentle teasing can be heard. Or, even a slight disagreement that might lead to silence for a while. But the silence is usually broken by a smile or a laugh or a joke told to cut the tension. What people who are casual observers might see are workers letting their hair down. However, what our students see are models of living and being in community that they soak up like dry earth after a rain. Our students see the adults in the community who like and accept each other in ways that feel familiar and familial. \nSo, too are the ways in which students gather for a short time to be on a team or a part of a play. Their working together can be influenced by each other’s personalities. Sometimes the mix of personalities can be off, or places in which the students have a hard time getting along. For instance, in a play where a performance can feel like walking out on a tightrope without a net, a student or adult actor literally simulates trust falls where someone throws a line, hoping that the person on the other side will remember to catch it, and then throw it back. As a young actor, or even a veteran teacher in the school play, can “go up” on a line, which means to forget a line or two entirely during the course of the running of a show with a “real” audience. The hope and expectation is that the other actor will remember, or at least ad-lib so that the actors can continue with the stream of a performance. These actors have to feel a sense of vulnerability, trust, belonging, and acceptance so that they can do their roles with some ease and effort. \nSimilarly, being on a line on a hockey team, or on any sports team for that matter, is about garnering trust that must be had where you expect the other person to pick you up when you make a mistake, like losing the puck in the closing minutes of a game with the other team on a breakaway to a finish that ends in heartbreak. In any effort at the school, we show each other that we belong and are accepted by picking each other up after such a devastating loss. We console in the moment, but perhaps later we have the hard conversation about doing better or being better, or knowing when a hug around the shoulder of a crying teammate or castmate might be a better response. \nIn every instance, what lies at the core of our time together is the belief that we belong to each other, that we will be accepted no matter what, and that we can return each time to be with each other to “pick each other up.” In the end, it’s about having the power to witness the connections being made by students, faculty, and staff as they each, as individuals and in community, try to navigate a world that can feel like Theseus’s labyrinth. They wander around thinking to themselves, “Where do I belong?” And, “Will I ultimately be accepted by these people?” Yet, community and true belonging and acceptance begins with a feeling in each person of what that means to them. For the adults, it is about modeling at a meal, each and every one of us. It means picking each other up when we falter and forget our lines, because we know the hurt when we forget them. It also means welcoming new people into our world because we understand that the work that we do with kids each day is not only important, but it is also sometimes the most sacred thing that we do each day. \nBrian W. Thomas, Proctor Academy Head of School \nCurated Listening:\nBelonging and acceptance makes me think of one song from the past, which is also in the form of a question; that’s Marvin Gaye’s “What’s Going On?” Listen to it HERE.",

I usually tell them that we have the unique position to be isolated and far enough away from the fuzzy, white noise of polarized debate about contemporaneous issues. It's not that our students do not track what is going on in the world -- the newly formed Current Events Club is an antidote to that -- but students at Proctor see themselves first and foremost as connectors rather than the spikey disruptors that tear at the fabric of most school and college communities.\nListen to Brian read his blog here!\nIn classes, you can often hear a lively debate that will lurch into contemporaneous political detritus. However, by and large, students make civil discourse their aim. They want people to feel not just like they belong anywhere on our 2500 acre campus but that they can also enter the stream of a conversation or even debate wherever they happen to be.\nIn a recent class, one student turned to another and said admiringly, \"I really love how your mind works!\" Perhaps we at Proctor have privileged civil discourse over corrosive debate. And what's so bad about bucking the norm?\nAs we begin to enter the hot button, single-issue voter period of the political season that is unfolding, perhaps that question and others will lead us back to what Proctor is truly world class at, which is process.\nI would say that American Democracy runs on its ability to stand on not just democratic principles but it also thrives on democratic processes.\nFor instance, when you head to the Wise Center and watch students queue-up to play pool upstairs, an orderly process reveals itself about \"who's got next?\" The way that students encourage and include the casual observer as they wait their turn, and perhaps sing a country-western song or three, you would think that you were in the middle of one of New Hampshire's treasures, its annual Town Meetings. People by and large who like each other and have a good time ribbing each other, too.\nAnother lesson in democracy and the democratic process can be observed in the way Weekend Activities and Project Period sign-ups happen, get promoted, and eventually executed fairly and squarely by who is first or within the confines of first-come, first-served. Project Period in particular is one of the few privileges that happen by class (seniors, and then juniors, and then sophomores, and then freshmen). Students come to trust that a fair process will happen when they wait their turn and follow an orderly protocol.\nFinally, the idea that each term students can have a shopping period for new afternoon activities each term is unique to any school in which I have worked. In a week or two, some students looking for a new activity or sport can try on four or five different ones, if they so choose. Students who have \"done a thing since kindergarten\" can switch up and do something different without anyone asking too many questions about it. They can be on the way to having a different experience, which might lead to a different path. One student I know has sampled a different sport for four years during spring term. Why?

  "text": "Over the past two weeks, Proctor’s Ocean Classroom students have experienced life on the open waters. As they entered the Gulf Stream and sailed south, we caught up with the student crew through daily journal entries and photos. \nTuesday, October 18 | Miles ‘24 \nWe all woke up to a beautiful day aboard the Harvey Gamage, currently docked in Gloucester, MA. We started our morning early with breakfast and our daily chores. Breakfast consisted of oats and blueberry muffins. Shortly after, we were invited aboard a beautiful fishing schooner from the 1800s. We all had a tour of the vessel and were able to see what it was like 200 years ago in the fishing industry. We were also taught about the maritime history of Gloucester. Shortly after the amazing tour of the schooner, we had a literature lesson discussing our future assignments and catching up on some work. After our class was dismissed we were starving and thankfully a great lunch had been prepared. Abandon-ship training commenced after lunch, reviewing what to do if we had to abandon our vessel out at sea. \nAfter the important training, we were granted free time until dinner. We were all very excited to explore what Gloucester had to offer. The first place I went was the nearest laundromat to wash all of my dirty clothes that have accumulated over the last couple weeks. I further explored the city and visited a Walgreens in search of snacks. I was not alone, many of my friends were walking down the aisles looking for goodies as well. After some time, I met up with some of my friends and headed back to the Gamage. After such a fun-filled day, some down time was needed. We came back to the ship to a luxurious meal of tacos waiting for us. As the sky gets darker, we begin to slow down and wonder what tomorrow will bring. \nWednesday, October 19 | Owen ‘24 \nAs we embark on our 3rd day in Gloucester, we begin the day with some breakfast and chores. We were given a lesson by Peter about water temperature and density based on salt and other minerals that rise to the surface when colliding with continental shelves. By the end of the lesson we were given an assignment to draw a planet made up of our imagination with its own ocean currents and land masses. After lunch we were then given time to check off sections of our sailing book. Following that we were given a fantastic lesson by Captain about currents and what was currently happening on our eastern coast. Jake then gave us some time to work on our midterms and to go ashore. We then had dinner brought to us by Henry’s Grandma and played guitar and sang as the sun set. \nThursday, October 20 | Olivia ‘23 \nMy day started at 06:00 as I had watch from 0600-0700. After waking pro-crew up at 06:30, completing boat check, and then waking all the crew up at 07:00 the day was started. Breakfast was bagels, potatoes, and bacon and my watch (C-Watch) was in charge of doing dishes. Then we headed into town and stopped by the fisherman memorial before we headed to the Cape Ann Museum. We saw some amazing works of arts and schooner models. I really enjoyed walking around the museum and learning more about Gloucester’s history. After the museum we went to a cafe which was such a nice treat. I got a smoothie and banana bread, which were both delicious. We headed back to the boat for lunch which was gnocchi! \nThe rest of the afternoon mainly consisted of class and debriefing our experience at the museum. Adam expressed that he “really liked how the color of the paintings in the museum depicted the vibrant soul of Gloucester’s working class fishing communities.” We had class with Anna Maria, Holly, and Jake today. We learned more about bearings, currents, ship procedures, and anchorage techniques. With Jake, we had a short discussion about “In the Heart of the Sea” in preparation for our departure tomorrow for Nantucket. I am so excited! I think my favorite part of today was learning and memorizing the different lines, sheets, sails on the Gamage with Ryan and Josh. We turned the activity into small little relay races, it was a lot of fun! Dinner tonight was rice, curry, and vegetables. My watch was in charge of dishes once again, but we all worked together and we were able to get through everything very quickly. The rest of the night was sort of our own time. Most of us worked on our midterm papers or played cards in forward. Overall, I would say today was very successful and predictive and I cannot wait for what our journey holds next! \nFriday, October 21 | Carrie ‘23\nA day filled with wildlife, joy, and travel. We started our day at the usual 07:00 wake up and breakfast at 07:30. What a beautiful Gloucester morning! After my typical morning oatmeal, I was ready for the day. A-watch got us underway out of Gloucester at the crack of dawn. The sun was still rising on our bow, and the distant Boston skyline on our starboard side. I spent the morning with a brief pre-lunch nap to prepare for my 12:00-16:00 watch. Lunch was absolutely incredible , together we spotted 5 humpback whales. It was so breathtaking and only got better! We spotted a feeding frenzy in the distance, birds, jumping fish, fins and chaos. As we got closer dolphins were jumping and swimming all around our bow. It was so beautiful! \nWe were about three hours into our 22 hour venture to Nantucket when we set sails to heave to and had class about 17 nautical miles off Provincetown. We learned about knots and more about our sails. After about an hour, the clock hit 16:00 which meant C-Watch was soon to be relieved. I headed back down to my bunk for some quick rest and then got woken up by the sound of the sails luffing and the call “hands to trim sails”. We were beginning a tack. It was just before sundown and the winds had picked up and only sound was the winds filling the sails. Soon after sail sheets were made fast, we were sailing 10 knots which was unreal. Waves were crashing and spraying over the rails. It felt as if we were in a movie! We had a beautiful sun set and a great warm dinner in the salon. I went down to my bunk to throw on all my layers and to grab my harness before C-Watches 20:00-0:00 watch. The stars were spanning the entire sky and below us were glowing bioluminescence. Stars above and stars below we like to say. It was another breathtaking day on the Gamage. \nSaturday, October 22 | Charlie ‘24 \nToday I was the chef’s helper so I got to sleep a whole night for the first time in a while. I woke up at 0530 to help cook breakfast. Soon after breakfast I was playing guitar and noticed some dolphins about 50 feet away. The dolphins came up and swam right next to our boat. They were so close you could hear them talking under water, it was one of my favorite moments yet. Shortly after, I spent my morning reading and working out. Before lunch, I went down and helped prep the food. I spent the afternoon playing some more guitar and hanging out with friends off-watch. Dinner came around and it took a while to make but we got it done and ready on time. After dinner, we mustered and then I had a 4 hour (1800-2400) watch. \nSunday, October 23 | Ben ‘24 \nAfter anchoring outside Nantucket, we got the chance to go ashore and explore and learn about the island’s history. Nantucket was mentioned a lot in the books we read this summer, including “In the Heart of the Sea”, so it was cool to be there in person. We got to Nantucket and we walked around. It was very interesting to see the old buildings. We went to the African American Museum on the island but it was closed, unfortunately. We ate lunch in the rain under a tree as the rain kept on coming down. Everyone was soaked, but the morale was still high. Then we went to a historic burial site for African Americans. The rain stopped for a bit and we had class at one graveyard and talked about the significance of the place. It started to rain a lot heavier now, worse than earlier, and we had to get back to the boat. We walked to the dock and waited (while being drenched!). Luckily Sam Liddle’s mom provided shelter for us and we were welcomed into their home. It was great and I am very thankful for their hospitality. We got to shower and dry our clothes. We had a great dinner, so much better than on the boat, and while not everyone could stay some of us went to other houses (friends of the Liddles). It honestly was great being in a dry place and comfortable beds for the night!\nMonday, October 24, Thea ‘24 \nThe morning felt like a whole new world. Waking up from our full night’s sleep either in king sized beds or cozy couches in a home with a real foundation and walls. To be honest, it felt bizarre; the rockiness of the sip caused by the sea state when getting woken up had become so normal to us. A little bit of land sickness overcame me as I stepped out of bed. It felt so strange. We were gratefully greeted by the hospitality of the Liddle family the night before when things went a little south and the weather halted us from leaving Nantucket Island. As much as we loved taking showers, washing our clothes, and sleeping in real beds, it didn’t feel like home. Our home was on the water, out at sea. \nAnyways, fast forward to 06:00 and we were all waiting at the dock with our stuff from the day before. We waited for the two little boats to come transport us back to the Gamage. Owen, Charlie, Zach, Miles, and I were the last to be brought back to the ship. ONce we passed the breakwater, the mast of the Harvey Gamage peaked through the fog bank, Proctor’s flag flying in the wind. Catching a glimpse of our home, a silent understanding settled over us as we all took in the beauty of our new home; one which we gained a newfound respect for. As we came upon the ship, we ran out of gas. Swaying back and forth in the waves, we switched to our second tank. Multiple attempts were made to start the motor, but it continuously failed. Miles stepped in and saved the day as he started her up on the first try! We got back to the ship and prepared to get underway. Our next stop was Martha’s Vineyard to re-fuel and then our three day passage to Cape May, New Jersey and on to Baltimore, Maryland. B-Watch was on watch for the time being, while everyone took long, needed naps.\nOnce we arrived and fueled in MV, A-Watch took the deck and embarked on our journey down south. It was a chilly, spooky evening. The fog was so dense, the bowsprit was invisible. Eventually, time passed and it was time to switch over the watches. A Watch was relieved and slept like babies. We were woken up for our 0000-0400 watch. As my sleeping self stabled myself on deck, I heard shots of excitement coming from the bow. Chuck and Owen invited us to watch something magical - over the side, pods of dolphins covered in bioluminescence were riding the waves on our bow! They would swim away leaving glowing trails of green water, then swim back in and continue to ride with the waves. It was beautiful, something I’ve never seen before. It was such a magnificent way to end the day, and start the new one. \nCheck out more photos from Ocean Classroom Fall 2022!",

As much as we loved taking showers, washing our clothes, and sleeping in real beds, it didn’t feel like home. Our home was on the water, out at sea. \n\nAnyways, fast forward to 06:00 and we were all waiting at the dock with our stuff from the day before. We waited for the two little boats to come transport us back to the Gamage. Owen, Charlie, Zach, Miles, and I were the last to be brought back to the ship. ONce we passed the breakwater, the mast of the Harvey Gamage peaked through the fog bank, Proctor’s flag flying in the wind. Catching a glimpse of our home, a silent understanding settled over us as we all took in the beauty of our new home; one which we gained a newfound respect for. As we came upon the ship, we ran out of gas. Swaying back and forth in the waves, we switched to our second tank. Multiple attempts were made to start the motor, but it continuously failed. Miles stepped in and saved the day as he started her up on the first try! We got back to the ship and prepared to get underway. Our next stop was Martha’s Vineyard to re-fuel and then our three day passage to Cape May, New Jersey and on to Baltimore, Maryland. B-Watch was on watch for the time being, while everyone took long, needed naps.\n\nOnce we arrived and fueled in MV, A-Watch took the deck and embarked on our journey down south. It was a chilly, spooky evening.  The fog was so dense, the bowsprit was invisible. Eventually, time passed and it was time to switch over the watches. A Watch was relieved and slept like babies. We were woken up for our 0000-0400 watch. As my sleeping self stabled myself on deck, I heard shots of excitement coming from the bow. Chuck and Owen invited us to watch something magical - over the side, pods of dolphins covered in bioluminescence were riding the waves on our bow! They would swim away leaving glowing trails of green water, then swim back in and continue to ride with the waves. It was beautiful, something I’ve never seen before. It was such a magnificent way to end the day, and start the new one. \n\n**[Check out more photos from Ocean Classroom Fall 2022!](https://blogs.proctoracademy.org/cs/c/?cta_guid=d58f95d6-2e50-4d2b-a08e-f23269fb03e8&signature=AAH58kHYx9p_NJP8DYOT6tqcbU8OW8wXCw&pageId=90662197868&placement_guid=137e0ac4-9fce-4cad-83de-64109fb6d8cc&click=21adea22-5d81-437f-8384-275a1e5b2dcc&hsutk=8380f9b086d8c936a008226094ed485e&canon=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.proctoracademy.org%2Focean-classroom-stars-above-and-stars-below&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&portal_id=408790&redirect_url=APefjpEf1_01q7O2EGj7uQyTrMWza9pjqH3CqMnG7dKp_Zt22eAi7oUgGC9W82OMWsN9ECaz7DSxgLDEZq0NkmNhfUHGFzat-1sho3vGx5-dPZ0PWJm-mKcZz18LXLt2kZOqorZuHp6-N-8uL33haBagBKFOpiyv9ZDrLY2hNZhnf0ImJx5DD5nZWmaw0Kk8xDZt9o1uVIuXuG2-BsQv5B5l9i6xIiYhi-R6C5VTah1ZCD9nvr03P-dy0lZA8ksIcJpD1z-DD2vblkw7XYZuciPSgPiOxBsaGg&__hstc=64846384.8380f9b086d8c936a008226094ed485e.1662494660989.1678388452457.1678393389530.379&__hssc=64846384.1.1678393389530&__hsfp=650144222&contentType=blog-post)**"

  "text": "For the past 52 years, the first week of September at Proctor Academy has been synonymous with Wilderness Orientation. While last year’s Orientation program had to be altered due to COVID-19, Proctor’s 118 new students are set to head into the wilderness of the White Mountains for five days once again. The experience that awaits them - the vastness of the wilderness, the challenges of hiking high peaks, and the relationships forged with classmates and faculty leaders - will lay the foundation for their Proctor journey. \nWe often field questions from new families about what to expect on Wilderness Orientation. The excerpt below of John Greenleaf Whittier’s poem The White Mountains provides a glimpse into the views and scenery of Orientation: \nThe White Mountains \nBy John Greenleaf Whittier \nThe sunset, with its bars of purple cloud,\nLike a new heaven, shine upward from the lake\nOf Winnipiseogee; and had felt\nThe sunrise breezes, midst the leafy isles\nWhich stoop their summer beauty to the lips\nOf the bright waters. We had checked our steeds,\nSilent with wonder, where the mountain wall\nIs piled to heaven; and, through the narrow rift\nOf the vast rocks, against whose rugged feet\nBeats the mad torrent with perpetual roar,\nWhere noonday is as twilight, and the wind\nComes burdened with the everlasting moan\nOf forests and of far-off waterfalls,\nWe had looked upward where the summer sky,\nTasselled with clouds light-woven by the sun,\nSprung its blue arch above the abutting crags\nO’er-roofing the vast portal of the land.\nLast year’s 50th Anniversary of Wilderness Orientation celebration was abridged due to COVID-19. While last year’s new students only were able to spend two days and one night in the wilderness, this year’s incoming class will have the full Wilderness Orientation experience that every Proctor student has enjoyed (or at least survived) since 1971. That which we learn by preparing for and spending time in the woods is not merely an outdoorsy activity to kick off the year, but rather a powerful grounding experience that centers us as we enter the beautiful chaos of an academic year at boarding school. \nIt is the lessons of planning, preparing, and executing a Wilderness Orientation route that we carry into the school year. We must be prepared, learn to trust those around us, pace ourselves, appreciate the little steps it takes to climb a great peak, take care of one another, and know that we each play an important role in making sure our journey is a successful one. These are the lessons former Assistant Head of School Chris Norris, former Head of School David Fowler, and others brought to Proctor from their time with Outward Bound in the early 1970s. They saw the power of small group experiences, where each member was stepping well outside their comfort zone, and experimented with how to overlay this educational model on a traditional boarding school. Fifty-one years later, we continue to benefit from their foresight and willingness to commit wholeheartedly to a grand experiment in building community that we remain a part of today. We cannot wait to get back in the woods this fall and put these lessons into practice alongside our new students! \nClick here for all your Enrollment Essentials!",

I hemmed the bottom and lined it with bias tape I made with silk ribbon, and I added a drawstring around the neckline to accentuate and help fit the area. In the afternoon, I began to cut out and tape together the pattern for the Petticoat. \nAndrew – Flight Rockstar \n8:30 Today, I began my day at flight school and learned about gyroscopic instruments with Alan. We then moved on to simulator flying, which went much better this time as we practiced steep turns and turns while ascending and descending. During our session, we also focused on navigation using the VOR and compass. At 12:00, I took a break to eat lunch and was back at it by 12:30. My first actual flying experience followed, with George as my co-pilot. I took off and practiced turning using the compass heading, but relied more on visual cues. When actually flying, I could feel the pressure of the plane, which was absent in the simulator experience. After landing, I spent the rest of the afternoon studying for the written exam until 5:00.\nNora – The Creature in my Room \nTuesday began with another lovely breakfast accompanied by some worries; reference photos. Lighting, background, expression, basically any nature of the photo and how well it will transfer to 2D and black and white. First at a bit after 8:40, was taking some new reference photos and choosing from past ones, such as this likely candid photo from the other night. After having some preferred photos I'd briefly look them over in editing through cropping and exposures. Once I'm satisfied I head over to the Library to print them out! (An extra note is how common grid scaling is! This was a Pinterest search for detailed charcoal portraits and a little way down all of these can be found.) With all of that, leads to this beautiful temporary scaling of Logan's face... This has at least assured me that I will be using thinner lines in editing. After scaling out a separate piece of paper, I begin dusting off my charcoal and grid work. It's been a good year or so but for a quick draft, I now know how to continue for tomorrow. Having finished up at 3:00 today with a solid six hours. In wrap, the day was more productive than I was expecting and I am quite content with how it went. As for tomorrow, I know what I need to get done and check over before I start on the final paper. \nElliott – Ski Building\nI started off the morning by finishing the designs for my top sheets. I created a top sheet for myself and one for my brother. I then went to one of my father’s ski building classes. He and his class were layering a ski and placing it into the press. A ski has multiple layers of fiberglass, a wood core, the base layer, and the top sheet. The top sheet is the fancy design that you see on every ski. all of these layers are held together by epoxy. After his class we came back to my house where we are currently running the CNC machine. The machine cuts the wood cores. It takes roughly an hour to cut each core. The machine takes an extremely large amount of programming and attention to run properly.\nAvery – Journalism of Cape Cod\nToday was both a huge success and failure. I had a late start to my morning as I was swamped with doctors appointments and a long drive, but I finally arrived in Woods Hole. I'm glad my first handful of interview spots were places I'm very familiar with. It certainly made it a lot easier to comfortably walk around and find people to interview. Not only was Woods Hole 10 times quieter than usual but I was definitely hesitant to \"bother\" people at first. That all went away when I stopped an older couple. They were on their way to an appointment, but I was able to get a solid amount of time talking with them. Unfortunately, they didn't give me much figurative information that I was looking for, rather just complaints about the traffic in the area. It was still good to break the ice and my nerves and talk to them. \nAfter I talked to them, I walked down to where all the ferries dock and leave from. I figured there would be enough people down there, and I lucked out. I talked to Jeff for a long time, and he finally gave me some answers I was looking for. I spent so long engaged in conversation with him I didn't even realize how much time had passed. I was very happy with my interview with him though. And I was lucky both interviewees had let me voice record them, which will make writing later so much easier. I then drove 5 minutes to Main St, a large retail and restaurant street in downtown Falmouth. This is another area I'm very comfortable in, and it's usually swamped with people and you have to park a 10 minute walk away. Today though, this wasn't the case, which was somewhat unfortunate as I was still looking for people to talk to. I walked around outside for a while but struggled to find anyone who wasn't busy or on the phone. I decided to get a bit more creative and began to enter businesses. \nMy first interviewee was a middle aged woman business owner, and I was very excited to talk to her. I was all prepared until all of a sudden she shut down and changed her mind. I was confused and a bit frustrated, but I made sure not to express it and thanked her for her time anyway. After that, I spent more time walking around, struggling to have productive time with anyone. I finally stopped to pet a friendly looking chocolate lab tied to a bench. I was just happy to be getting some puppy time when a small woman came outside and talked to the dog. She was the owner, and she worked in the store the dog was tied outside of. I figured I might as well ask, she seemed friendly enough. She said yes and we entered a small overcrowded store I'd actually never been in before. She was not a fan of my request to record her, which was okay because I just took more detailed written notes. I quickly found she was not a huge people person, which was part of her reasoning for the lack of recording. However, she was super easy to talk to and gave me great answers. Some of the customers in the store even chimed in sharing information which was really helpful for getting many different perspectives. My former frustrations disappeared following my conversation with Melanie and the customers. I was reminded of the kindness I came looking for. Although I had struggles today, I was able to successfully begin to identify some of the themes I was looking for, and got 3 interviews done. I planned to do some writing today, but my struggle to engage in actual conversations with people prevented me from having time to do so. I'll definitely be doing a lot of organizing and writing tomorrow, but I'm really excited for that!\nEmma – Houston Wildlife Rescue\nDuring my first day alone, I have already gained valuable insights into the intricate workings of the wildlife rehabilitation process. First, I learned how the wildlife rehab department works and got to know the technicians and other volunteers. I was amazed by the dedication and compassion of the technicians and volunteers at the Texas Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, who work diligently to provide care and support for the animals in need. Their devotion and expertise made the volunteering experience even more inspiring. With their assistance and guidance, I got to feed some baby birds and the \"bug farm,\" which sounds pretty gross, but it was actually really cool! After all, we need live and healthy bugs to feed our birds! Additionally, I also learned to make some enrichment toys for squirrels using twigs and leaves, and they went \"nuts\" over them! So, from feeding the baby birds to creating enrichment toys for the squirrels, the experience was both rewarding and educational. After lunch and a short nap, I spent a few hours, from 3 to 6 PM, researching scientific infographics and the processes of wildlife rehabilitation in Texas. Learning about the different approaches and techniques used in wildlife rehabilitation was interesting. Overall, it was a productive day, and I feel grateful for the opportunity to learn and give back. I'm excited to learn more skills tomorrow and gain new insights, especially with the abundant amount of opossums we have in the center!\nRead Proctor's Senior Project blogs posts HERE!",

  "text": "Mar 12 2023 12:16 PM \nIn just over a month, Proctor’s 120 new students will head into the wilderness of the New Hampshire’s White Mountains for five days of backpacking, camping, and exploring. The experience that awaits them - the vastness of the wilderness, the challenges of hiking high peaks, and the relationships forged with classmates and faculty leaders - will lay the foundation for their Proctor journey. \nOver the past year, Proctor has been in the midst of a strategic visioning process that is challenging us to think about what the next chapter of Proctor will look like. We must decide what aspects of Proctor will remain and what will need to be set aside in order for new opportunities to emerge for the school. As we have conversations with parents, students, alumni, employees, and members of the Board of Trustees, we ponder how the culture of an organization sustains over time? Is it the people? Is it the mission? Is it the programs offered? What is it that allows Proctor’s unique culture to thrive year after year, and how do we cultivate continuity when we welcome new faculty, staff, and students to Proctor’s community each September? One of the answers lies in our 52 year commitment to Wilderness orientation. \nIn 1971, former Head of School David Fowler and Assistant Head of School Chris Norris introduced the concept of Wilderness Orientation to Proctor. Wilderness Orientation effectively weaves mission and people into an incredibly powerful, complex, cultural underpinning of the school as eight students and two faculty leaders embark on the five day, four night backpacking trip. Each year we have some families ask if such a rigorous orientation experience is necessary. Each year we respond with confidence that the experience of Wilderness Orientation catalyzes the relationships that serve as the foundation of Proctor’s culture, and it is worth our time, energy, and investment to ensure we are prepared, trained, and equipped to have the best start to the year possible. \nLast summer, David Fowler passed away, but his writings and legacy live on. As he entered his final year as Head of School (1994-1995), David wrote to faculty and staff, “One of the reasons Proctor has done so well over the years is due to its clear mission. Our job is to support that mission in all we do. The mission dictates the programs that we have, the values that we feel are important, and the type of student we want to have at the school. If we forget who we are and who we are committed to serve, then the clear purpose of the school is clouded and frustration and confusion can sap our energies and educational commitment.” \nCollectively, we have a responsibility to keep that mission clearly in focus, and Wilderness Orientation helps us do just that. The power of the wilderness is real, both in how it can challenge us and how it can build us up. We have resisted the temptations to stray off the path, to take the easy trail, to bend to the fears of those who do not fully understand why we do what we do. When we have a mission that centers us, and a community that believes in that mission, we hold the course. We do the hard things because we believe in their impact on our community and their contribution to our continuity of culture, a continuity so many organizations lack. We prepare our bags, lace up our boots, pack our gorp and sleeping bags, and embark on the best, hardest five days of the year.",

Because we believe deeply in the value of immersion learning, and this week provides an opportunity for us to dive into learning experiences that simply do not fit into our regular academic schedule. \nIntroduced in the mid-1970s, Project Period has evolved, morphed, and even went away for a brief period in the early 1990s, before today’s version of a five day immersion learning experience where faculty create learning experiences around their passions. Hiking in the White Mountains, learning expedition skills, teaching fitness and finance as the foundations for life, dog sledding, taking a hunter safety course, or learning the intricacies of quilt making are just a few of the dozens of projects offered. \nOur goal is for students to learn a new skill, be exposed to a different worldview, engage in community service, and find a new passion, but we also want students to break outside of their normal social structure and develop relationships with others who may not run in their usual social pack. Mixed aged groups draw students from varying backgrounds together around a central topic, and the results allow us to watch our students shine in ways we never knew possible during Project Period. The unique talents of a learning population as diverse as Proctor’s are not always apparent in the traditional classroom, but in Project Period, we are reminded of our students’ gifts. \nRarely in our lives are we granted the opportunity to put all else aside and focus on one project. We love the stimulation that comes from our normal academic schedule; always something new, something exciting, jumping from one class to another, one conversation to the next.

  "text": "Feb 15 2023 8:24 PM \nWhat do we do with our outrage? This is the question first year student Alice Ryan ‘26 was grappling with when she first learned about the executions of political dissidents in Iran. \nWhen Mahsa Amini was beaten to death by Iran’s \"morality\" police for allegedly wearing her headscarf too loosely, the nation rose up in protest. The \"morality\" police are infamous for their violence and the arbitrary nature by which they arrest and punish those who break the rules of their country, which is governed by Sharia Law. Since Mahsa’s death the people of Iran have been protesting bravely, risking and giving their lives in the process. The exact number of those executed by the Iranian government is unknown but it is at least in the many hundreds – many teenagers among them. Using social media and VPNs to circumvent the authoritarian state’s stranglehold of the internet, Iranians’ stories have reached more people outside their country than ever before. \nWhen the hashtag #stoptheexecutions reached Alice, she had been unaware of the atrocities taking place in Iran. While social media is often an outlet that receives more criticism than praise, it can be a powerful tool for spreading vital information. Alice found herself enraged and horrified about what was taking place and paralyzed with a feeling of helplessness. She took these feelings to her advisor, English Department Chair Shauna Turnbull, who helped Alice devise a plan.\nMartin Luther King Jr. Day was around the corner, so Alice used this opportunity – a day when we all turn our focus towards social justice and uplifting the voices of those on the margins – to organize a group to create protest signs for Iran. Alice, Shauna, and their new cohort (digitally) joined the Iranian protests, sharing images of their posters and the names of those imprisoned, with hopes of being a part of the loud voice to stop executions.\nInspired by Alice and her work to educate her fellow students at Proctor and join a global movement, I thought there might be a way to continue to expand the conversation. My dear friend and former graduate school classmate, Mehrnaz Mohammadi, is an Iranian actor, writer, and director living in Los Angeles. I connected with Mehrnaz and told her of Alice’s work at Proctor and invited her to join us for a roundtable video call. Mehrnaz has an extraordinary story of her own – one that includes being jailed by the morality police and the eventual decision to leave Iran and her family behind to immigrate to the United States. Mehrnaz shared her stories as well as the state of Iran from a native’s perspective. \nAs Mehrnaz was speaking about the bravery of those protesting in the streets, she was asked about her own decision to ultimately leave in search of a better and safer life. She looked at our students and said: “You know great things await but you also know you have to sacrifice a piece of yourself to attain them.” After Mehrnaz spoke these words, a hush fell over the room, and we let their power sink in.\nIt is often outside the walls of the traditional classroom that we gain the most perspective. Experiential education takes many forms – some days it may look like a trimester at sea, and on others it looks like the face of Mehrnaz Mohammadi. This discussion offered students a glimpse into a world far beyond Proctor, and an opportunity to gain a perspective that would not have been possible without the courageous voice of someone’s first-hand experience. Thanks to Alice’s initiative and Mehrnaz’s willingness to engage with the Proctor community we were able to share this profoundly moving experience and, hopefully, learn ways to positively harness our outrage for good.\nClick to see Proctor's Educational Model in action!",

Thanks to Alice’s initiative and Mehrnaz’s willingness to engage with the Proctor community we were able to share this profoundly moving experience and, hopefully, learn ways to positively harness our outrage for good.\n\n**[Click to see Proctor's Educational Model in action!](https://blogs.proctoracademy.org/cs/c/?cta_guid=4d3ebec3-dc75-4422-9b21-28751abca464&signature=AAH58kHrGL-DtHkKKGW21U422-YtHkIHzw&pageId=102695952559&placement_guid=e34fcffc-9efc-4de7-8c2e-be28ade131db&click=e3656215-c0ea-4fe6-ae7c-57cfb465c86c&hsutk=8380f9b086d8c936a008226094ed485e&canon=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.proctoracademy.org%2Facademic-lens-turning-outrage-into-action&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&portal_id=408790&redirect_url=APefjpHZAbKejPqxWDpQHuWRHxxUUnGg9WPZUf_BAPMOW2QuI9Th94J3lfYQGPxt0uDoLynPO4z9MbEhaHOh7GLpCtfeENjgpFaqEO3pVvxuN8pU_gtwNTSq3jC8x2DLX4cKTHMZ8VlFy1z0DAiyxSlWknFgEJuBl2AJ96ChjNe7QleOLNZpd2hfBimg_rMxUvK22vGhy6-QTtsR15pIXg6p9i06xgsWImYUUTYYP1a9x4WYLjTK3I8bdJE7xkTqLjuXixzTzPnV&__hstc=64846384.8380f9b086d8c936a008226094ed485e.1662494660989.1678661816137.1678666752237.386&__hssc=64846384.1.1678666752237&__hsfp=1411068630&contentType=blog-post \"Click to see Proctor's Educational Model in action!\")**"

  "text": "Last week ten Proctor folks, four students and six faculty members, traveled to San Antonio, Texas for the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) Conferences – the Student Diversity Leadership Conference (SDLC) and the People of Color Conference (POCC). \nListen to Brian read his blog here. \nThe sole aim of both conferences is to offer place and space for questions - and answers! - about belonging and acceptance in independent schools. There are more than 1,600 independent schools in our Association (NAIS) in the United States, which totals northwards of 2,000 schools worldwide. As John Gulla, former Head of the Blake School in Minneapolis MN and now the Executive Director of the E.E. Ford Foundation says, “Independent schools are engines of meritocracy,” ensuring that all segments of American society have a seat at the table in creating diverse and compassionate thought leaders and changemakers who will help us solve some of the world's biggest challenges in the years and decades ahead. \nI believe what John posits deep in my bones, and it is the reason why I have spent the lionshare of my time, 28 of my 33 years as a full time teacher and administrator, in independent schools. That’s “full grown” in dog years.\nKidding aside, during this year’s POCC and SDLC, we talked a lot about how people - faculty, staff, parents, and students - belong, or sometimes feel like they do not belong, in our schools. Now, that may sound like a bunch of hard and uninviting conversations and workshops to be had deep in the heart of Texas in the shadow of the Alamo. Yet, these discussions happened at a time in Proctor’s journey, as well as in the journey of many other schools in NAIS, when it feels like we all are, every one of us, in the middle of the rapids of a fast-moving river. However, in my 33 years of attending the POCC, they are not (always) hard conversations. Indeed, joy abounds, especially when I get to see myself represented in our students and colleagues from other schools in our national association. Our reflection of a world that mirrors a myriad of communities throughout the nation, and not just in the Northeast.\nAt POCC and SDLC, folks get together, and have gotten together since 1988, to ensure that even the most fragile among us have a voice and some choice in crafting and co-creating experiences that will move the needle for them in terms of their own agency at their schools and eventually in their own lives. The conference is about connection and positive forward motion. Thanks to our schools, people can still move from poverty and powerlessness or from strength to strength, so that they all can be productive members of society. To add context, even Proctor has moved from being an all boys prep school in Northern New England to being a place where all students and people are seen and accepted for who they are and what they uniquely bring to the table. Dr. King’s dream of creating a “beloved community” remains alive and well here. I reflect on what Proctor and the rest of our schools have done throughout the centuries, but especially over the last fifty years. \nYet, we do see some dark clouds on our horizon.\nAccording to Charles Vogel, one of POCC’s keynote speakers, we are living in an era of one of the most disconnected times in human history, largely due to the pandemic, racial reconciliation, and political division. Vogel suggests that we need to build spaces, like Proctor Academy as well as other schools and communities, that serve as campfires for human connection, which is a place where all people can gather around a common purpose and get to feel the warm glow of being uniquely who they are (belonging) and are given grace for who they are and what they each bring (acceptance). \nHow do we counteract the disconnection that many of us and our students feel day-to-day?\nWe can and we should replicate these campfire moments, holding each other accountable with data, qualitative and quantitative, and stories to ensure that every person can thrive while finding meaning in our differences and delight in our similarities.\nWe have done this over the years at Proctor. In fact, we have created mountains of campfire moments over the last three months–and 174 years. Recently, we have seen skiers coming in from Panorama in Canada and snowpack in Colorado, juniors and seniors leaving Proctor en Segovia and Aix in Provence to re-engage with their peers here in Andover, and other good and stalwart friends regaling us with their tales aboard the Harvey Gamage as they sailed from the harbors of Maine and down the Atlantic seaboard and around the Florida Keys. At times, we even create real campfires and bonfire moments that resound with the warm glow of mutual respect and connection across race, culture, resources, time, and communities. Our experiential model “flexes” – in multiple definitions of that word where we “muscle up” and “adapt” to what we are called to do in all the places and spaces that are our classroom. The world.\nSan Antonio was a revelation because we remembered more than just the Alamo at POCC and SDLC. For our gentle crew, we remembered. We remembered why we are so strong in our convictions and so uniquely centered in our gratitude for this place that is Proctor, and its people.\nBrian W. Thomas, Proctor Academy Head of School \nCurated Reading and Listening:\nWhen I think of poets, I look near and far. The poet that I was searching for this week, Martín Espada, had a special friendship with our own famous local poet Donald Hall who as many of you know loved the Boston Red Sox and lived nearby.

  "text": "In mid-July, Proctor students and teachers traveled to the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota for a two week summer service learning trip. This engagement of Proctor students alongside the Lakota community in Rosebud continues a nearly 40 year relationship between the two communities. Read reflections from this year’s trip below. \nIn recent memory, Proctor has sent a group of students to the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota for five of the last seven summers. Every time I see the community, the land, and the Lakota culture through fresh eyes. This is the gift of being a teacher. The lessons and experiences never tarnish because with each new group of students you are awash in that sense of discovery. This year was no different. \nThe twelve students who were visitors, joined a current Proctor student and four Proctor alumni in their community to learn and to work for ten incredible days. The trip is a sprint marathon. At the end of every day we muse, well tomorrow will be a busy day. Truthfully, everyday is busy. As JR White Hat ‘00 aptly said one evening after a good meal and as a storm rolled in, \"You don't come to South Dakota to sleep!\" No, our days were filled with painting walls, pruning trees, mowing grass, organizing clothing and materials, hauling sand, building retaining walls, grooming horses, learning, listening, and wondering.\nOne evening, as dinner wrapped up and I watched Mark White Hat ‘14 chat with his former advisor Patty Pond and listened as Dee Lonehill '92 shared about her time at Proctor with Freya Crooks's mom, I could feel the web of Proctor's community grow stronger. We were reminded that the most valuable thing we can give one another is our time. The students were on board with this attitude and gave every moment all they had. We weren't there to sleep. \nLori Patriacca ‘01, Dean of Faculty Development and Native American Program Coordinator \nI walk away from my time in South Dakota simply in awe of the White Hat family and how they continually give of themselves for the betterment of their community. It is hard not to stand in awe while listening to, and watching, each matriarchal figure share their work in the community. Marlies White Hat works diligently to help provide things for the reservation by means of grants and programs for the community. Linda Vargas Garriett works each day to provide resources for the reservation through her work leading the Tree of Life, a thrift store, food pantry and community outreach center. Each woman greeted our group with enthusiasm and kindness. Their leadership qualities have spread to their children and grandchildren. \nJR White Hat ‘00 has a way of speaking that encapsulates pride for his Nation, pride for his family and cultures, but more so a pride for humanity, like none I have ever seen. When he speaks, people listen. You want to listen. You want him to feel respected and heard. He works hard to continue his parents’ community outreach as well as continuing Lakota traditions and culture. He is a natural teacher and our students truly enjoyed spending time with him in a sweat, learning about the Sundance ceremony and seeing the love he has for his family and community. As he shared with us, \"Lakota people believe that the only thing that you truly own is your body. It is the only thing you can truly give. The biggest gift you can give to someone, is your time.\"\nAs a person who does not practice a specific faith or have strong ties to religion, I was eager to learn more, and was truly humbled by the dedication and sacrifice the Lakota people make for their culture and beliefs. Even after the almost 100 years of cultural devastation Native Americans endured while not being allowed to speak their language, practice their faith, and truly be the people they are, they have held tightly to their own customs, traditions, and beliefs. The American Indian Religious Freedom Act passed in 1978 ensured Native communities the ability to freely practice their faith, speak their languages, and embrace the fullness of their way of life. I was born in 1979. This is a really hard fact to swallow, one that I struggle to fully put into perspective as I think about the oppression of these communities that has only recently been acknowledged by the federal government. \nLastly, being able to witness the connection that both Patty Pond and Lori Patriacca ‘01 have with the White Hat family, and other Lakota people, I felt proud and thankful. They have spent so much time on the Reservation, they are respected members of Proctor, and without that, our students would not have the opportunity to visit, learn, and work. Because of the work that Patty and Lori, and so many others before them - George Emeny, David Fowler, Albert White Hat, Bert Hinkley, John Around Him, and others - have invested in the Proctor/Lakota Sioux friendship, I was able to experience a truly remarkable connection between two communities for two weeks in the middle of July. I look forward to returning to learn more and to help steward this relationship into the future.\nJill Jones Grotnes, Art Faculty and Faculty Co-Leader Summer Service Trip\n“I had the most amazing time being immersed in the Lakota traditions and experiencing them firsthand. Watching the Around Him Sundance unfold in front of me was definitely my favorite part because it felt incredibly spiritual. The buffalo hunt was quite magical as well, especially because the process was respectful, as well as kind to the presenting bison.” - Freya ‘26 \n“The White Hats welcomed us with open arms inviting us to observe their sacred rituals such as the Sundance, sweat lodge, and buffalo hunt, treating us as an extension of their family. I am constantly reminded how rarely these opportunities to learn from and witness these ceremonies comes along. Leaving with a new perspective and a sense of fullness from my contribution, I feel so grateful for the relationship Proctor shares with the Lakota people.” - Whistler ‘25 \n“With every question we asked our daughter about her experience, she answered with such detail and reverence for the Lakota community and their practices. We can tell by the way she spoke so adoringly about JR and his entire family, that they opened up their world in such a kind and meaningful way, and because of that, she brought home such a lasting understanding, respect, and genuine appreciation for the Lakota way of life. The seeing, the feeling, the doing, and the truly connecting to each other and the world - that’s the good stuff and we are so grateful.” - Nifty, P’23, ‘25 \nCheck out more photos from our 2023 Summer Service Trip!",

  "text": "When we peel back the layers of Proctor’s educational model - the programs, buildings, and people who make up our community - we find a shared understanding that, at its core, our work is to create, sustain, and teach young people how to live in meaningful relationship with others. The past two days of faculty professional development covered a wide range of issues, all centered on creating and sustaining an inclusive community that celebrates the remarkable diversity of learning styles, family histories, cultures, and backgrounds that exists within Proctor. \nIn Brene Brown’s most famous Ted Talk on vulnerability, she cuts to the core of our work of community building, work that is rooted in belonging: “There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it. And that was, the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging. That's it. They believe they're worthy.” \nThe beauty of the Proctor community is that we do not claim to be a flawless educational institution where students arrive as uniform, pre-finished products. Instead, we are energized by their rough edges, uniqueness, and the beautiful mess of adolescence. We allow students to show up in their own brokenness, with their educational wounds poorly bandaged but ready for the healing balm of love and support found in a place like this. We celebrate neurodiversity because of the richness different learners bring to our classrooms, our dormitories, our teams, our studios, and our advisories. Similarly, we ask each member of our community to bring their own story to their Proctor experience - their own family, own background, culture, and life experiences. When we see each other in this light, we unlock the potential for learning in a powerful way. \nThursday morning, led by our Office of Equity and Belonging, we spent three hours in small and large groups learning about, discussing, brainstorming, and exploring gender and sexual identity. We talked about the differences between engaging in conversations for comprehension versus compassion, recognizing our work with students who are exploring their own gender and sexual identity must always, always be rooted in compassion. We asked ourselves how we, as adults, can continue to explore the world of gender and sexuality to build awareness and literacy essential for a compassionate and inclusive community where everyone has a sense of belonging? We do not claim to have answers, but we are excited to engage in the journey alongside our students. \nThursday afternoon we explored the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework and how our work at Proctor potentially overlays with this structure. In small groups, we thought about our own approach to teaching, the structure of our classrooms, the intersection of Learning Skills and our academic classes, and how we can best serve the incredible diversity of learners at Proctor. Recognizing the value in developing our own language for learning, this exercise using UDL’s framework served as a valuable launching pad. \nFriday morning we welcomed the S.E.A.L Foundation, whose mission it is to create and fund educational and social opportunities in both non-public and public schools, and camp settings for students who learn differently in order to ensure they maximize their potential. In small groups, faculty worked their way through six simulation activities to illustrate what it feels like to learn with different learning differences. While our faculty’s learning profiles are as diverse as our students, the simulations were an incredibly powerful way to empathize with our students who have a documented learning difference (roughly half of Proctor's population). \nWhether it was completing a writing exercise while only looking in a mirror (representing dysgraphia), attempting to complete a spelling test with muffled audio (representing an auditory processing disorder), decoding a complex scientific research paper with mixed up letters (representing dyslexia), or completing a math worksheet with inverse operations (representing dyscalculia), we experienced first hand the frustrations, challenges, and mental energy required to engage in the learning process if you have a learning difference. \nWe head into the start of the school year with new perspectives, increased empathy, and tools to help those in the community whose brains, bodies, and souls feel different than society says is “normal” feel more at home. Our job, at its most fundamental level, is to help adolescents understand and feel confident in who they are and how they can contribute to society. We got better at our job today, and share a deep appreciation to our Teaching and Learning Team for leading us through these professional development days. \nClick here to read: The Alchemy of Community 1+1=3.",

  "text": "Jan 15 2024 8:17 PM \nToday was not a day “off”, but a day “on” as we celebrated Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. We learned about King’s life and legacy through the sharing of stories and experiences in assembly and in advisory groups. As we listened, spoke, meditated, and explored, we wrestled with big questions. What if we, as an imperfect society, sought justice for the oppressed with the same conviction that those in power seek to stay in power? What if we took time to honestly reconcile the racism and oppression on which America was built?

Dean of Faculty Lori Patriacca ‘01 shared perspective on the recency of the Civil Rights Movement within the context of our lives, noting the work of Proctor students in the 1990s to push the State of New Hampshire to finally adopt Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a state holiday in 2000 (the last state to do so). Theater faculty Charley Stern ‘09 followed with a powerful recitation of a passage highlighting the “Stranger’s Case” from Shakespeare’s Sir Thomas More, and Head of School Brian Thomas offered his thoughts on King’s underlying message of acceptance and fighting against feeling “othered” in his speech he gave to a group of students at Barratt Junior High School in Philadelphia on October 26, 1967. Faculty members Scott King and Amy Mathison then shared a beautiful, powerful song rooted in lyrics from King’s speeches before we welcomed Chris Allen ‘12 back to campus as the keynote speaker. \nAs Chris took the stage, he seamlessly wove together the strands of each piece of the morning’s assembly through the sharing of his own story. Raised on the southeast side of Washington, DC, Chris arrived at Proctor as a ninth grader hungry for the experiences the school would provide, and fully aware of the privilege that came with the opportunity to be here. He talked about being exposed to different types of people, to new sports and activities, to learning about rap music from the most unlikely of friends, finding a home in Proctor’s recording studio, at Elbow Pond, and in the friends who saw him for who he could be, not where he came from. As he spoke, our student body began to see pieces of themselves in Chris. \nA professional musician who is in the process of launching his own record label and recording studio with the aim of increasing access to the music industry to those farthest from opportunity, Chris implored each of us to dream out loud and to share that which we too often hold to ourselves with those around us. It is in those moments of dreaming out loud that we begin to see in ourselves the same potential others see in us. \nIt is in this space of dreaming out loud that we have the opportunity to impact the world around us, and that we begin to believe that our life has ultimate significance. Our role as educators is to kindle the unborn flicker of hope that lives in each of our students, a hope that too often can be extinguished because of injustice, unbelief, or stereotypes. It is a hope that allows us to see and love and appreciate the full humanity of others, to not necessarily know what it feels like to walk in their shoes, but to acknowledge that it is not the same as our shoes. It is a hope that recognizes that that which we do for the most marginalized in this world, we do for all of us. It is a hope that sees through hypocrisy and empty words and teaches us to love unconditionally. Today, that hope was nourished on many levels. \nThank you to all who made today’s celebration of MLK Jr. Day so powerful, and especially to Chris Allen ‘12 for reminding us to dream out loud, regardless of how old we might be! \nFollow Proctor on Instagram for More Content!",

The Hays Speaking Contest does both. The finalists of the event, selected by the participants themselves, serve as a state of the union of Proctor’s current sophomore class. As the event’s host, English teacher Tom Morgan, gives the audience members a glimpse inside of the window of the lives of our students who stand and deliver their speeches.\nListen to Brian read his blog here!\nThe Hays Speaking Contest was created by former trustee, parent, and teacher, John Pendleton, who passed away this past September. The competition was named in honor of Bill Hays who was a former Bowdoin College debate team standout and former Proctor Academy Board of Trustees Member. Each year, and for the past 24 years, the contest provides the sophomore class a vehicle to talk about the most pressing issues of their lives as well as a way for a larger audience to hear a smaller subset of the class listen in on the raw materials of those members of our community who are nearly half-way through their Proctor careers. \nAbly moderated by last year’s Hays Prize winner, Chris ‘24, the stakes were high from the outset, given the gravity with which the participants gave the proceedings as well as the length of time the competition has been a staple at the school. The speaking competition gave us all that momentary glimpse into the window of each of the speakers’ lives.\nAs Chris regaled all of the speakers with advice about how to collect their thoughts and channel their nerves into action, each person approached the podium with poise and confidence to discuss personal yet clear-headed memories from their pasts. \nThe first speaker up was Sierrra ‘25 who talked about a personal yet harrowing event. Her message of hope tinged with the clear conviction about adults, especially the ones she found at Proctor, being a good listener to young people is a powerful message that impacted everyone who heard her speak. \nNext up was Will ‘25 who recounted his real struggles being among the one in four people who have a learning disability that he now realizes is a super power. Even though the complicated nature of having a super power that can sometimes impede or distract school work, or life in general, Will gave us food for thought with his story of his relationship with and acceptance of his super power. Will left us all with the impression that he is someone who knows himself and his strengths incredibly well. \nAfter Will spoke, Conrad ‘25 implored all in attendance to think hard about labeling and dehumanizing “the other” in our fractured political climate, particularly those with whom we disagree. Conrad described vividly a trip he took with his parents a few years back to Europe, watching a fringe political party rise to power again in Germany. Conrad artfully connected his own story of unexamined followership to last year’s Supreme Court decision that struck down Roe v. Wade, deftly arguing how easy it can be to slip into the dehumanization trap with those with whom we are allied as opposed to those with whom we disagree. \nJaden ‘25 was up after Conrad. While the idea of wrestling with one’s conscience may have preceded Jaden, his appeal implored his classmates to look closer at the people behind the statistics when looking at victims of gun violence. Recounting an incident that happened in his hometown in the midwest, Jaden took the listener on a ride that showed the mundane everyday events of playing a video game that was soon punctuated by gun violence with its faceless, nameless imprint on Jaden’s city and neighborhood that shattered his own home and even his own body. \nYet, the external wounds that students often feel can be very hard to deal with, Morgan ‘25, walked the listeners through the life of a Proctor student dealing with the FOMO (fear of missing out), even at times when a student, especially a high school student, knows intimately the corrosive nature of social media and the inability to disconnect. The story that Morgan tells is one that many people her age deal with, which is how the ubiquitousness of social media wrecks a healthy self concept, creating a negative feedback loop of false equivalencies. Her antidote was in being offered a place on one of the off-campus programs at Proctor, which allowed her to disconnect and maintain a more focused and self-aware existence.\nNext, Toby ‘25 took us all on a journey with he and his family in their Sprinter van through the region around the Alps in Europe. As in Morgan’s speech, Toby wrestled with finding the meaning of living a teenage life with three other people in a van, his family, even on a milestone birthday. Toby came to understand how important and valuable the time away was from his technology and even other people in getting to know himself and his family better. Toby’s realization that “nothing is everything” freed him from many of the tricky comparisons that people his age often make.\nLast but not least, Paige ‘25, solidified and grounded the evening in Brené Brown’s concept of vulnerability when she allowed herself to be trained by a family friend to become a better soccer player. With gales of laughter, the audience discovered Paige’s soft spots of humility mixed with humor as she refused to acknowledge her own vulnerability until it literally leaked out of her after a soccer training session one hot day. Being vulnerable for Paige was about squarely facing her own humanness last summer while vowing to face the person who trained her, leaving her embarrassment behind.\nAll of the Proctor students did what the Hays Speaking Contest was designed to do, which was to honor the memory of two Trustees and to provide a vehicle for human connection at a time in their careers when the end seems to be just a bit longer than the beginning. \nBrian W.

  "text": "Mar 13 2023 8:11 AM \nThe intersection of big, tough issues facing society, perfectionism projected into the lives of adolescents through social media and parental expectations, and a desire to support students through the COVID-19 pandemic has created an environment in our schools where we must delicately balance student well-being and expectations. How do we authentically manufacture adversity for young people who live in a world that seeks to shelter them from it? \nAs a part of Proctor’s Strategic Visioning process, we surveyed students in their English classes. One of the questions asked students what they believed were the biggest challenges facing adolescents today.

  "text": "Too often in our blog posts, we share the work that is happening in our classrooms, studios, and athletic fields from the perspective of the adult. We talk about our philosophy of education, of community building, of putting young people in situations that both challenge and support them. Today’s post simply shares the work of a handful of AP Environmental Science students as the class embarked on a project investigating and researching climate mitigation efforts around the world. \nScience Department Chair and APES teacher Alan McIntyre asked students to choose a location, for some their hometown/country and for others a place they were interested in learning more about, and to investigate what climate mitigation efforts were underway to reduce greenhouse gasses and pollution. Each student chose to approach the project differently, and each uncovered powerful data, stories, and reflections that exposed them to new information and connections related to a place about which they care deeply. Explore a few of the student blog posts linked below, and read on for excerpts from Lola ‘23 and Romy’s projects. \nLola Randolph - Sun Valley, ID\nRomy Smith - Vienna's Smart City\nJon Groth - Boston \nMolly Brenner - Boston\nElliot Norris - Worcester, MA\nHieu Nguyen - Vietnam\nKatie Vlacich - Concord, NH\nEaling Zong - Tufts University \nLola ‘23: Climate Mitigation in a Ski Town, Sun Valley, Idaho\nSun Valley is a small ski town nestled among the mountains of Idaho. Sun Valley is a popular tourist destination due to its unique outdoor offerings, including amazing mountain biking in the summer months, and world-class skiing during the winter months. The Sun Valley Resort was established as the first destination ski resort in America in 1936. Sun Valley is part of the greater Wood River Valley area which is home to around 17,000 people, many of which rely on jobs in the tourist-driven industry to make a living. With the natural resources in the Wood River Valley being such a huge part of resident and non-resident lives, it is vital that the valley takes action to mitigate the effects and risks brought on by climate change. The climate-saving actions that Sun Valley takes to protect the ecotourism-rich area, can also serve as examples for other ski resorts around the U.S. \nMaking Snow-Making More Efficient: \nWhat would skiing be without the snow? Well, whatever it would be, I'm sure it wouldn't be nearly as fun. While the majority of the snow on the ski hills in Sun Valley falls from the sky, the hill usually needs a boost of man-made snow to get the mountain open in time for Thanksgiving day every year. Snowmaking can use a lot of energy, and in recent years the resort began replacing the older, less efficient, snowmakers with new more efficient ones. My sister who works as a ski patrol woman for the resort has witnessed this replacement process first hand and when I asked her about it she said \"they've started replacing the old snow gun heads for more modern ones which are cutting down on electricity usage by 700%, which pays for itself in about half a ski season.\" Since 2014, 283 of the 578 Borax snow guns have been replaced with the more efficient Rubis EVO snow guns. The best way to prove just how much more efficient the Rubis EVO guns are than the Borax guns, is to look at the data the resort has compiled. \nHere are a few of these data pieces: \nCost per acre of snow-\nBorax (45 Horsepower): $438/acre\nRubis EVO (3 Horsepower): $18/acre\nIn 2016, 125 Borax guns were replaced with the Rubis EVO's, and 697,125 KWHs of energy were saved. The resort is now saving enough energy every year to provide 127 houses with power, that is no small number, and truly goes to show just how energy other resorts could save if they did the same thing!\nThis project allowed me to look into my hometown in a way I never had before. I had no idea that the Sun Valley Resort was doing anything to help reduce its impact on the environment, and now I know the different steps that they are taking to do so. Reaching out to my grandma and sister about this blog gave me insight into how two very different, but similar in some ways, professional fields have experienced these changes that the resort has made. When I found the article about what Sun Valley was doing I was very excited as I was able to see not only what they were doing, but the data that proves the efficacy of the things they are doing to prevent climate change. This in-depth article allowed me to now project what I have learned onto the readers of this blog, and hopefully help them understand the impact that a big company can have on reducing its impact on the climate when the proper steps are taken. This project proved that while implementing more efficient systems can be expensive up front, these systems actually end up more than paying for themselves typically within the first year.\nRomy ‘24: The Concept of a Smart City and Vienna, Austria\nWe were tasked with investigating climate mitigation and/or adaptation plans in our homes. My home is Vienna, Austria. To begin with, I chose Vienna instead of Bethesda, MD because I wanted to explore the difference in action between the US (which I believe the majority of my peers will be focusing on) and a more European approach. \nThroughout my research, I found myself almost overwhelmed by the numerous different resources. As a result, I was able to rely on reliable sources, coming directly from the Viennese government and the UN. As I was researching, I learned about all the different ways that it is possible to address climate change without appearing 'radical' or having to invest large sums upfront for a long term environmental and cost benefit. Despite not really putting much direct emphasis upon the topic, I found the concept of a Smart City to be the most appealing and interesting approach to a sustainable future. Although it may be a little silly, I'm amazed that the strategy isn't more common and that I haven't heard of it outside of seeing the phrase on posters when walking around the city. I think that I'm so impressed with the Smart City Strategy as a way to mitigate climate change because even though its emphasis is sustainability, the quality of life of Vienna's (Austria's) citizen's hasn't been negatively impacted- in fact, their quality of life has increased. I'd love to be able to see a similar framework begin to appear in more North American Cities, like NYC or Boston. \nPersonally, the more I looked into Vienna's approach to climate mitigation, the more I'm falling in love with the city all over again. I've moved a lot growing up, and Vienna was definitely the place that I'll miss the most. When I was younger, I protested with Greta Thunberg's Friday's for Future movement, one of my friends became so involved in the protests that she ended up speaking at a protest in front of several thousand people. As I'm looking back to those days, I'm realizing that even though I fully believed & fought with the movement, that I'd never put much effort into researching Vienna's actual and current efforts. I believe that I can excuse myself, only being in eighth grade, but after this project, I've come to realize that I not only love the city - I'm also very proud of it. \nLearn more about Proctor's Environmental Stewardship Efforts!",

Although it may be a little silly, I'm amazed that the strategy isn't more common and that I haven't heard of it outside of seeing the phrase on posters when walking around the city. I think that I'm so impressed with the Smart City Strategy as a way to mitigate climate change because even though its emphasis is sustainability, the quality of life of Vienna's (Austria's) citizen's hasn't been negatively impacted- in fact, their quality of life has increased. I'd love to be able to see a similar framework begin to appear in more North American Cities, like NYC or Boston. \n\nPersonally, the more I looked into Vienna's approach to climate mitigation, the more I'm falling in love with the city all over again. I've moved a lot growing up, and Vienna was definitely the place that I'll miss the most. When I was younger, I protested with Greta Thunberg's Friday's for Future movement, one of my friends became so involved in the protests that she ended up speaking at a protest in front of several thousand people. As I'm looking back to those days, I'm realizing that even though I fully believed & fought with the movement, that I'd never put much effort into researching Vienna's actual and current efforts. I believe that I can excuse myself, only being in eighth grade, but after this project, I've come to realize that I not only love the city - I'm also very proud of it. \n\n[Learn more about Proctor's Environmental Stewardship Efforts!](https://www.proctoracademy.org/fs/pages/366)"

  "text": "Mar 13 2023 9:20 AM \nIn the spring of 2012, Josh Norris and Alan McIntyre's Project Period challenged students to calculate the potential solar production possible on rooftops around campus. The assignment eventually morphed into a larger scale project for a handful of students that would lay the groundwork for Proctor’s first solar array installed on the Wilkins Meeting House in December of 2012. Over the past decade, Proctor has installed eleven solar arrays on campus with a twelfth planned installation in the spring of 2023. \nTotal solar production from Proctor’s twelve solar arrays will total over 800 megawatts of electricity each year, roughly 20% of the school’s overall electric consumption. While the power purchase agreements for some of the arrays do not allow Proctor to claim all of the renewable energy credits associated with the arrays, the unique PPA arrangement has allowed Proctor to install the arrays for little to no cost, essentially leasing rooftop space to ReVision Energy. Proctor then agrees to repurchase the electricity produced at a discounted rate. In a few years time, Proctor will have the opportunity to fully purchase the arrays, and then will be moving toward powering nearly half of the campus from its solar, both reducing costs and reliance on fossil fuels. \nThe timeline of installations follows: \n2012 - Wilkins Meeting House (73,000 kwh)\n2015 - Teddy Maloney ‘88 Hockey Rink\n2015 - Proctor Recording Studio \n2015 - Proctor Day Care Facility \n2015 - Alan Shepherd Boat House \n2015 - Proctor Ski Area (131,000 kwh) \n2017 - Burbank East and West \n2017 - Head’s House and Annex \n2017 - Brown Dining Commons \n2019 - Mike Henriques and Betsy Paine Outdoor Center \n2022 - Farrell Field House (412,000 kwh) \n2023 - Woodlands Center\nSince 2008, Proctor’s Environmental Mission Statement has served as a north star for institutional decision making. This mission, written by students and adopted by the Board of Trustees, challenges the Proctor community to teach and practice sustainability by establishing and sustaining a carbon-neutral footprint on campus, providing systems and services that encourage behavior, innovations, and technology that reduce our resource consumption, purchasing goods and services that are ecologically responsible, increasing organic, local, and healthful food choices each year, empowering current members of the community to be active stewards for an equitable and ecologically healthy earth, and exploring the social, ecological and economic problems that confront us all, as well as the means to address those challenges on our campus and in our personal lives each day.\nProctor’s Environmental Mission Statement led to the installation of a biomass plant to power the campus’ central steam system in 2008 and provided a powerful institutional decision-making lens that led to significant investment in solar power as an additional renewable energy source for the school. By aligning economic opportunities with this environmental mission, Proctor partnered with Revision Energy to install solar arrays on as many south-facing rooftops as possible. The school’s second largest array, the ground mounted Proctor Ski Area array, allowed the ski area to shift to electric snow-making compressors and to close the generation/use power loop on one of the school’s largest consumers of resources. Likewise, the array on the Teddy Maloney '88 Hockey Rink powers one of the other highest consumption buildings on campus. \nOver time, as the cost of solar continued to drop, Proctor identified east/west facing rooftops that that were now economically viable options for solar. The Mike Henriques and Betsy Paine Outdoor Center and Teddy Maloney ‘88 Hockey Rink arrays modeled this east/west facing alignment and set the stage for the school’s largest array to date, the 412,000 kwh Farrell Field House array installed this summer. The array covers more than one acre of rooftop and nearly doubled the school’s overall solar production. \nAs Proctor engages in a Campus Master Planning process over the next six months, the school will continue to identify opportunities to leverage renewable energy sources, to install more electric vehicle charging stations on campus, and to keep the Environmental Mission Statement front and center as Proctor's campus continues to evolve.",

They paint, read, cook, learn, travel, and immerse themselves in the study and creation of art and communal living. The group’s recent excursions took them to Florence, Italy and around the countryside of France. Read more from Bretton ‘25 and Isla ‘25. \nBretton ‘25\nFlorence was amazing! There were so many highlights, for one getting to go to the Uffizi was amazing. I was not the biggest art person coming on this off campus program, but learning about art work such as “La Primavera” painted by Botticelli and then getting to see it in person was amazing. After the Uffizi we all spent some time at the Duomo in Florence which is the dome part of the cathedral there. The Duomo is a beautiful piece of architecture that most of us sketched in our carney. When we weren’t in Florence we were in Bologna, Italy. Bologna had an amazing museum in it with a lot of religious pieces, some even by the very well known painter Raphael. Coming back from Italy everyone was super exhausted so we spent the weekend resting and catching up on work. Everybody is excited to get back to our normal schedule, my favorite part being literature class in a cafe in town. Going off campus was definitely something I had never even dreamed of, but I am so happy I did. It has been full of experiences and opportunities I never would have had otherwise and I am so thankful for that! \nIsla ‘25 \nOn Tuesday after visiting the medieval town of Ansouis, in the Luberon, to paint and have a picnic. We drove back home but stopped at a small memorial for World War II. Free French Resistance fighters lived for almost two years in this isolated spot in an 11th century chapel. They were eventually discovered and surrounded by an overwhelming force of German soldiers. The French eventually ran out of ammunition and all prisoners were summarily executed. \nWe stopped for about 30 minutes to draw and feel the presence of those who had passed.

  "markdown": "Each trimester, two faculty directors (Dave and Jen Fleming) embark on an eight week mission to create an artist colony in the south of France alongside eight students. They paint, read, cook, learn, travel, and immerse themselves in the study and creation of art and communal living. The group’s recent excursions took them to Florence, Italy and around the countryside of France. Read more from Bretton ‘25 and Isla ‘25. \n\n![Proctor Academy European Art Classroom](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1697720888/proctoracademyorg/n2jk7nv8juaezphn7ljz/IMG_1218.jpg)\n\n## Bretton ‘25\n\nFlorence was amazing! There were so many highlights, for one getting to go to the Uffizi was amazing. I was not the biggest art person coming on this off campus program, but learning about art work such as “La Primavera” painted by Botticelli and then getting to see it in person was amazing. After the Uffizi we all spent some time at the Duomo in Florence which is the dome part of the cathedral there. The Duomo is a beautiful piece of architecture that most of us sketched in our carney. When we weren’t in Florence we were in Bologna, Italy. Bologna had an amazing museum in it with a lot of religious pieces, some even by the very well known painter Raphael. Coming back from Italy everyone was super exhausted so we spent the weekend resting and catching up on work. Everybody is excited to get back to our normal schedule, my favorite part being literature class in a cafe in town. Going off campus was definitely something I had never even dreamed of, but I am so happy I did. It has been full of experiences and opportunities I never would have had otherwise and I am so thankful for that! \n\n![Proctor Academy European Art Classroom](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1697721111/proctoracademyorg/mywtr6c7yuxa2zepakqo/IMG_6295.jpg)\n\n![Proctor Academy European Art Classroom](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1697720990/proctoracademyorg/orc7nezqbbwlbc6zp2ze/IMG_6353.jpg)\n\n## Isla ‘25 \n\nOn Tuesday after visiting the medieval town of Ansouis, in the Luberon, to paint and have a picnic. We drove back home but stopped at a small memorial for World War II. Free French Resistance fighters lived for almost two years in this isolated spot in an 11th century chapel.  They were eventually discovered and surrounded by an overwhelming force of German soldiers. The French eventually ran out of ammunition and all prisoners were summarily executed. \n\n![Proctor Academy European Art Classroom](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1697721008/proctoracademyorg/wwnl4r8uiw1ejihzwikc/IMG_0359.jpg)\n\nWe stopped for about 30 minutes to draw and feel the presence of those who had passed. As we sat and sketched we noticed how silent it was there. There were no birds, wind, or people,  just us and this important piece of history. After drawing we walked up to the memorial where Dave taught us the meaning behind the Free French Cross of Lorraine and talked about the people who had names on the plaques, one of whom was a citizen of Vauavenargues, our little town. \n\n![Proctor Academy European Art Classroom](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1697721039/proctoracademyorg/yf1ico893zeswm53lyfp/IMG_1181.jpg)\n\nOur next excursion on Friday took us to Les Baux, a small town in the mountains where houses were built into the rocks and a castle that sat on top overlooking miles and miles of olive groves and vineyards.

  "text": "From the moment we woke up on May 1st at 2am, we were in for a week of adventure, incredible architecture, art beyond belief, and delectable Belgian food. We base camped in Ghent, at a hotel with buffet breakfast, which we all took advantage of. But spent our days exploring the cities of fairytales (as Jen would say). \nDay 1 is travel to Belgium, set up in Ghent, visit the Jan van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece (THE LAST DAY BEFORE IT CLOSED FOR RESTORATION!!), and our first real Belgian meal at Bier Central. \nThe ultra beautiful Antwerp Central Train station.\nDay 2 is Brussels, Mannequin Piss, Royal Museum of Fine Arts, and the best chocolate I have ever had in my life… which I will come back to.\nDay 3 Antwerp, Helen and I venture to see her grandfathers old apartment, passing too many diamond stores on the way to count, and finishing the afternoon at the KMSKA, a museum I fell in love with, so much so, that I actually got stuck in a time warp and ended up being 23 minutes late to meet the group (Again, so sorry). \nDay 4 is Bruges, a city that takes you back in time, preserved through both world wars, and with tangible energy that makes me feel like I should be walking down the streets in a gown and wooden clogs. Here we saw Michelangelo's Madonna and Child. Stolen numerous times but most recently by the occupying army of Nazi Germany. She plays a large role in the acclaimed film: Monument Men who of course brought her back to where she belongs.\nDay 5, we make our way home after a leisurely morning, in which I get to practice my French the whole way to the city of the future: Charleroi.\nOk… but I promised I would come back to the chocolate, and I am a woman of my word, so here it goes: We are set free for lunch in Brussels, Cadi, Eva, Helen, and I make a beeline back to the Royal Gallery of St Hubert’s. A hall of stores each with little windows that display the goods of the shop. This hallway is the epitome of what all malls should look like, with sky high ceilings that bring you into the era of Baroque architecture. On top of the beauty of the building itself, at least half of the shops are chocolatiers. We were released at noon and had to meet up at 2:00, so of course post a quick stop for lunch the only logical remaining thing to do is try all of the chocolate we can get our hands on. \nFor the next hour and a half we stop into every chocolatier in the gallery, each of us picking a different flavor to try, we must have tested at least 10 different shops, and too many little truffles to count. Everything dark of course… dark chocolate caramel, dark chocolate hazelnut, dark chocolate praline, dark chocolate rose, cherry, basil, ganache, you name it, we tried it in dark chocolate form. We finished our exploration with chocolate dipped strawberries, and practically skipped the whole way back to the meeting point. Sugar high beyond compare, smiling so hard my cheeks hurt, we were all happy, and in need of a serious chocolate break. At least until the next city.\nThat was an afternoon well spent. And I’m worried I won’t ever be able to enjoy chocolate that isn’t in Belgium the same way as I did before this excursion.\nPhoenix '23\nCheck out European Art Classroom on Instagram!",

Henry ‘24 shares reflections from the last week and their excursion to Rome in today’s blog post. \nHenry ‘24 \nDuring our last week at the house, we prepared to head off to Rome for the upcoming week. On Monday, we had our last Literature class in town. Then, on Tuesday, we ventured to St. Remy, the mental institution where Van Gogh enrolled himself in the later years of his life. We were lucky enough to see the room where he stayed and the ice baths with locks they used as shock treatments. We then executed our last plein-air painting of the term, which was a success for most. On Wednesday, most of us finished our book projects, which have been ongoing all term, and we started painting the covers of our book projects. Jen and Dave also took us out to an all-you-can-eat buffet. Thursday was a work day to touch up some plein-airs and our book projects.\nFriday, we took a trip to Cassis, our second time here, but rather than painting, we were here to relax. We had a nice lunch where most students got fresh seafood such as linguine with seafood and mussels. We then explored the small beach town and then headed to the beach. Even though the beaches on the Cote-de-Azur are primarily rocky, it was pretty nice being on the beach with a slight breeze. We then headed back home and had our usual pizza and movie night. \nSaturday was our last day in Aix. We got ready and went out for our last lunch and market day. The boys enjoyed fresh cuisines from the market, such as paella and roasted meat, and the girls returned to their favorite Mediterranean place, Tita. We spent our last hours of daytime in Aix and then headed back to the house to finish our book covers. We then return to Aix for dinner, where everyone enjoys a nice dinner and is ready to go home. Sunday is a relaxed packing day. We clean the house with all of our art supplies and other items. Everyone has finally finished their book project and book cover. After much hard work, everyone was happy with the results. We have a great final week of the term ahead. We are heading to Rome with layovers and back to Frankfurt and Munich. We are excited about the great food, monuments, and artwork. This has been an excellent experience for all of us, with a noticeable improvement in everyone's artistic abilities. \nCheck out more photos from European Art Classroom on Flickr!",

  "text": "Feb 12 2024 9:28 AM \nProctor’s European Art Classroom program heads into their final weeks together studying art and culture in Aix-en-Provence, France. Like any intensive group experience, there have been ups, downs, and remarkable growth within each of the eight students taking part in this winter’s program. Students continue to create art as they travel throughout Europe. Read reflections from Conrad ‘24 on the past week preparing for an excursion to Amsterdam in this week’s blog. \nConrad ‘24: \nThis past week, our group of eight were faced with the fact that our time in France is dwindling. It was a busy week before our stay in Amsterdam, working diligently on our book project and final studio art painting, the Bird. \nOn Monday, we began learning Dutch, which is full of humorous vocabulary and translations. Post-Impressionism was the focus of our art history lesson on Monday. On Tuesday, we got a \"tour of our backyard,\" aka Mont Sainte-Victorie. On this tour, we met a friend whom it felt like we knew for a lifetime. We were blessed to interact with Monique and witness her craft and stunning property. She graciously let us plein air paint around her house. A soccer game commenced on her lawn, and the injuries were minor before we said our goodbyes. \nDuring our in-house day on Wednesday, we had our last studio art lesson after we chose our birds. We returned to Le Festival on Thursday to discuss our penultimate book reading. Friday was rainy, but Rembrandt, Picasso, Van Gogh, Cèzanne, and Louis David all made up for the depressing weather. The guys sought a taste of home at Five Guys to fuel our day of three museums. \nThe day after, the weather worsened as we made our birds before we hit the town for our Saturday night dinner. Sushi, Pasta, and Steak filled our bellies before we set out to watch a movie. When we arrived at the movie theater, a comedy of errors ensued. First, we got the room wrong, and then when we got to the correct movie, a group of local university students stood behind us, confused as to why we were in their seats. A worker came over to engage in what sounded like a heated debate with Jen.\nEventually, we left the movie theater without receiving the entertainment we had hoped for, but a movie streaming site saved the night because we got to watch the movie in the end and in our PJ’s. This Sunday, we purchased our Super Bowl snacks and prepared for our all-nighter before our 6:30 AM flight to Amsterdam.\nCheck out more photos from European Art Classroom!",

  "text": "Proximate learning does not occur without risk, but it is in those moments when students are living their education alongside the issues they are studying that worldviews are transformed. Next Friday, students interested in studying on one of Proctor’s five term-long off-campus programs for next year will submit applications for these programs. Some will apply to study off-campus for the first time, while others will look to cap their Proctor experience with a second or third trimester abroad. So why is it that more than 80% of our students choose to study off-campus? \nWe believe deeply in the value of learning as a process, not a specific outcome. Proctor’s model of academic rigor mixed with academic support results directly in a school culture that frames challenges in a way that encourages perseverance and provides opportunity for healthy struggle. We believe there is no better place to authentically encounter this type of learning than through a study abroad experience where independence, self-advocacy, and self-awareness become primary tools for each student. Fully funded by boarding tuition and operated entirely by Proctor faculty members, our five term-long off-campus programs have shaped nearly every student's Proctor experience over the past five decades. \nProctor's educational philosophy rooted in hands-on, experiential learning opportunities has a history that dates back more than seventy-five years. In large part, this is why our off-campus programs are always full, providing 100 students each year with a truly life changing experience. This culture of studying off-campus is a byproduct of on-campus support systems - relationships with faculty advisors, learning specialists, dorm parents, teachers, coaches, and parents - building the confidence in each of our students to step outside their comfort zone and into the challenges that await them in an off-campus program. As students work to finish their applications for next year's programs, browse our five term-long programs below to see what all the hype is about! \nMountain Classroom\nSince 1972, Mountain Classroom has stood as a cornerstone of Proctor's commitment to experiential learning. During the winter and spring terms, ten students and two experienced instructors embark on a ten week exploration of the American West, gaining first-hand experience from local activists and guides. Combining outdoor education and academic inquiry, Mountain Classroom students examine the complex and intricate connections between nature and culture. This winter's Mountain Classroom program is currently exploring the backpacking in Northern Vermont before making their way west for the remainder of the term. \nOcean Classroom\nSince 1994, Proctor has offered more than 450 students the opportunity to board a tall ship and voyage along the eastern seaboard of the United States and into Caribbean waters. Students are not just passengers studying marine science, maritime literature, history and navigation during their term on Ocean Classroom, but are active crew members as well. From the first moment students step foot on the vessel, they are divided into “watches”, the core working group on any ocean-going vessel, answering directly to their professional watch officers. After nine weeks studying in partnership with Semester at Sea (SEA), students are transformed learners and experienced sailors. Offered during each fall trimester, Ocean Classroom has the potential to be one of the most powerful experiences that a Proctor student can have. Learn more about Proctor's new partnership with SEA HERE. \nEuropean Art Classroom \nEuropean Art Classroom is an art immersion program based in Aix-en-Provence, France. During the winter and spring terms, eight students and two Proctor faculty dedicate themselves to the study of the finest arts and culture of Europe. The group resides together in a beautiful private home where they learn about group living and hone their art skills in the spacious art studio and on excursions to local sites. \nIn addition to taking literature, art history, and language classes based in Aix, the group travels to three other European cities to further explore cultural and artistic themes. The program takes full advantage of Europe’s finest art museums, theater, musical performances, and old-world charm. This program’s vibrant combination of art, travel, and study inevitably leads to heightened aesthetic sensibilities and personal discovery.\nProctor en Segovia\nSince 1974, Proctor students have had the opportunity to live with a Spanish host family while studying Spanish language, literature and history in the ancient Roman city of Segovia, Spain for a nine-week term during fall, winter, and spring trimesters. Through complete language and cultural immersion, Proctor’s teaching faculty in Segovia combine classroom instruction with weekly excursions, both locally and throughout Spain's diverse regions, in order to craft a uniquely challenging, and equally rewarding experience for ten students each term.\nProctor in Monteverde\nProctor en Monteverde is a program primarily for sophomores who are academically and socially mature and ready for a cultural immersion adventure in Central America. While living with host families organized through Proctor en Monteverde Program Director, students attend classes at the Monteverde Institute. Students continue their sophomore level science, humanities, math, and Spanish classes alongside native Costa Rican students, while engaging in arts and afternoon activities in the local community. Each student earns a full year's worth of Spanish credit during the ten weeks of this program. Monteverde, Costa Rica is one of the most ecologically diverse areas in the world providing unparalleled learning opportunities ranging from planting trees for reforestation to constructing farm related engineering projects such as irrigation systems or bio-digesters for methane production.\nLearn more about Proctor's Off-Campus Programs!",

This program’s vibrant combination of art, travel, and study inevitably leads to heightened aesthetic sensibilities and personal discovery.\n\n![Proctor Academy Off-Campus programs](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1701987747/proctoracademyorg/acxrjzj3lm1u6popnxpk/52633742850_1818587e68_o.jpg)\n\n## [Proctor en Segovia](https://www.proctoracademy.org/off-campus-experience/proctor-en-segovia)\n\nSince 1974, Proctor students have had the opportunity to live with a Spanish host family while studying Spanish language, literature and history in the ancient Roman city of Segovia, Spain for a nine-week term during fall, winter, and spring trimesters. Through complete language and cultural immersion, Proctor’s teaching faculty in Segovia combine classroom instruction with weekly excursions, both locally and throughout Spain's diverse regions, in order to craft a uniquely challenging, and equally rewarding experience for ten students each term.\n\n## [Proctor in Monteverde](https://www.proctoracademy.org/off-campus-experience/proctor-en-monteverde)\n\nProctor en Monteverde is a program primarily for sophomores who are academically and socially mature and ready for a cultural immersion adventure in Central America. While living with host families organized through Proctor en Monteverde Program Director, students attend classes at the Monteverde Institute. Students continue their sophomore level science, humanities, math, and Spanish classes alongside native Costa Rican students, while engaging in arts and afternoon activities in the local community. Each student earns a full year's worth of Spanish credit during the ten weeks of this program. Monteverde, Costa Rica is one of the most ecologically diverse areas in the world providing unparalleled learning opportunities ranging from planting trees for reforestation to constructing farm related engineering projects such as irrigation systems or bio-digesters for methane production.\n\n## [Learn more about Proctor's Off-Campus Programs!](https://www.proctoracademy.org/fs/pages/370)"

  "text": "Nov 16 2023 8:00 AM \nEight students, along with co-directors Jen and Dave Fleming, completed their European Art Classroom experience this past weekend. After nine weeks of living, learning, and creating art together, this group has an inextricable bond that will carry them through the rest of their lives. Read final reflections from European Art Classroom Fall 2023 below, and learn more about the program HERE. \nEiley ‘25 \nAs we wrapped up our time on European Art Classroom, we spent our last week in Strasbourg, France. After taking in the art of Italy and Spain it was an amazing experience to end our trips in the north of France. We saw museums full of famous artists such as Bottechelli and Peter Paul Rubens, as well as museums full of new ideas and modern art. To be able to compare modern to older techniques is such an amazing opportunity and it really helps me to see the evolution of art and what remains timeless. We also got to experience the culture of such an interesting city that has been under control by both Germany and France many times over and manages to blend the lifestyle of both countries in such a unique way. We took short trips to both Colmar, a nearby French town, and Kehl, a small town in Germany. Seeing the impact that the history of these three places had on their architecture, languages, and overall culture was so impactful. This educational experience was such an amazing opportunity and I am so grateful for my parents for helping me find proctor and encouraging me to go on this amazing off campus program.\nLucy ‘25 \nEuropean Art Classroom was a once in a lifetime truly amazing experience. I traveled to three different parts of Europe in 2 months and when not traveling I was immersed in French culture. I made many strong bonds with the people on Euro and had some of the best conversations. There were some nights where I couldn’t even get to bed because of how hard I was laughing with everyone. Dave and Jen taught us so much history and culture about France. They both teach in a way that is engaging and they are wonderful, kind, and caring people. I am very grateful to have had them as my teachers. I came out of this adventure a different person and if anyone is thinking of doing European Art Classroom, it would be a mistake not too. \nBretton ‘25 \nComing onto Euro I was nervous about how it would be structured considering I did not have as strong of an art background as the other students. I quickly grew in my art ability and never once did I find myself not completing a piece of art because I “couldn’t do it”. Dave and Jen really became second parents for me on this off campus program, and they were always trying to make me laugh and have a good time. I loved how the classes were set up, being able to have exposure in town and practice speaking in French. With Jen, she helped make my French stronger. I have no regrets about choosing to apply and I really wish it wasn’t over. Euro has helped me see the world in a different way because it was my first time out of North America, and I am so grateful for the opportunity that I had. \nNorah ‘24 \nNow that European Art Classroom is over, I can’t help but feel grateful for all the adults in my life. I am glad that my Mum, Aunt, and Mimi helped me achieve something of this magnitude. They gave me courage to take this big of a step in my life that I will never forget. \nConrad ‘25 \nWell here we are. It’s the morning of November 12th and we are homeward bound. This term flew by faster than a speeding train, but I know I did my best to soak up every drop. I am so thankful to my family for making it possible for me to experience this and of course, Jen and Dave for making it all happen. It’s been a good run. \nIsla ‘25 \nThank you to my family, especially my grandparents, who helped make this possible. I’ve enjoyed this term so much and it’s been an amazing life experience. \nSally ‘24 \nThank you Mom and Dad for making this happen! I’m so grateful for your trust and support through my journey, see you soon! Love you! \nAddie ‘25\nThank you to my parents and my grandfather for making this happen. I loved every moment of it!

  "text": "Nov 6 2023 9:13 PM \nProctor Academy’s European Art Classroom program enters their final week of studying and abroad in Aix en Provence, France. Over the past eight weeks, students have lived and created art in community, traveling all over Europe visiting the very art they have studied in their art history courses.

Yesterday evening, for instance, I thought I would try to use my admittedly developmental French skills to talk to an artist at a multinational art exposition in Marseille. Naturally, I quickly found myself way in over my head with one of the most talkative people I have ever encountered, hardly able to understand a word she said. But through persistence and patience, we were able to communicate in a primitive but mutually entertaining sort of way.\nExperiences like that, the awkward floundering of an American abroad, are perfectly contrasted with picturesque sunsets and memories made exploring a landscape and way of life that is beyond idyllic. We’re almost done with week number five of EAC as I write this. For me, that’s deep enough into the term that what was at first mind-blowing and exotic, starts to become trivial. But every time we all pile into the van and get our socks knocked off by some incredible place that Dave takes us to, I come back home with a renewed gratitude and appreciation for this place and this opportunity. The fact that attending a prep school like Proctor is an option available to a minuscule number of people when considering humanity as a whole, is not lost on me.\nThe reality that I not only get to go to Proctor but that I get to do this is not something that I will allow myself to take for granted - no matter how entrenched into our routines we become. I know for a fact that the remainder of this trip is going to fly by faster than a speeding bullet. So my hope for myself and for all of us is that we are able to soak up every last drop of this experience, which is likely to end up being one of the highlights of my entire life. Wish us luck.\n-Conrad '25 \nThis week, the proctor European Art classroom went on an extravaganza to Spain! We stayed in Valencia but traveled to Madrid for one day.

We also share a shout out to Mountain Classroom instructors Jeffrey Prado and Jeaneen Shedd for their remarkable leadership, skill, and commitment to the program as they both embark on new adventures next year! \nHap ‘24 | The Door Lottery \nMountain Classroom is a culmination of a bunch of small things that add up to make an entertaining day. The largest culmination of these small things came in the form of Final Expedition: a four-day backpack in West Virginia on our own, while our instructors follow far enough away to not have to listen to us-this is so we learn how to operate on our own. The main additions to the culmination didn’t come until day two of the backpacking trip when we were suddenly reminded of why Jeffrey said the tent we had was a bit of a fixer upper. This fixer upper began with Jeffrey reminding us that he had a four person tent that needed some light repairs. After said light repairs to the rain fly were completed we celebrated at how smooth the zipper was. Three weeks later on Final Expedition, that previously buttery smooth tent zipper had developed an attitude. We reached a point where the zipper zipped without zipping anything, like open air housing. At this point we figured that the zipper would work 1 out of 10 tries, which was significantly worse than the previously 1 out of 3 times. We quickly discovered shutting the door was like entering a lottery. \nAfter eventually winning the lottery we were off to bed for another long day. After covering our miles we found a nice campsite near the river. We got to cooking dinner and then eating said cooked food. After eating we gathered around the campfire to relax after our biggest day of the expedition when we suddenly heard a bang. The bang in question was a football sized rock that had exploded from the heat. Luckily the only scratch dealt by the rock was in our minds on making sure the fire stays away from the edges of the fire ring. Other than this and the pesky tent our final expedition was a great success - we only lost the trail twice! Final Expedition is a prime example of how Mountain Classroom has been able to turn a group of house dwellers into a group capable of functioning by ourselves in the outdoors. As a group we plan out our days, find campsites, and figure out how to eat spaghetti with a spoon. \nEnrico ‘24 | Back in New Hampshire \nFrom dry mesas filled with kangaroo mice to sandy gulches, I have been living where there has not been any greenery. For myself, I became confused with what was a totally new landscape for me. I believed that the west was all prairies with a couple desert spots, but there were so many valleys, cliffs, and mountains. My brother, Dante, had been on the previous Mountain Classroom trip. He mentioned Walmart trips and cowboys but never had he told me what I would see. \nThere would be times where I could only see red rock for miles. Other times I would be surrounded by one hundred foot tall cliffs on all sides. It was all so interesting to see. Every new place the class visited had beautiful views of geology formed from millions of years. These views could only be seen in the west. The lack of trees allowed us to navigate the land with ease. However, the nights were so much colder. \nWhen our group began traveling farther east, the deserts disappeared and the prairies and open plains made way. Animals that I believed to be extinct such as prairie dogs and bison littered the land at the National Parks. Elsewhere was all flat farmland. \nSoon the prairies and plains disappeared. Deciduous forests began to show on the mountains and then surrounding our campsites, blocking the view. Then, before I knew it, I was back in New England. Right now, I am surprised that the term has gone by so fast. I feel as if we had started not too long ago. This off-campus classroom was definitely a fun time for me.\nCheck out more photos from Spring 2023 Mountain Classroom!",

  "text": "Proctor's Mountain Classroom program enters its final week of its term off-campus and its final student-led expedition. This group has learned so much about themselves, a sense of place around the country, and the varying cultures in which they have immersed themselves. Read two remarkable reflections from Olivia '23 and Ella '23 below. \nOlivia '23: Defining \"Home\"\nWhat defines a home? This has been a question many of us have grappled with on Mountain Classroom, yet recently we were all introduced to another new and different definition of the word home. Just like we have adapted to our lovely bus, Deb, as our current home, Community Rebuilds (CR) in Moab is changing the picture of how people envision a home, as well as the construction process. \nOn April 19th we were given the amazing opportunity to volunteer and help build an adobe home on one of CR’s work sites. The CR mission is all about creating safe, affordable, and sustainable housing changing the way people view and perceive house construction. As soon as we stepped onto the work site I was immediately blown away with the dedication and commitment to creating a more sustainable and sheltered future for so many homeowners. The homes hold an immense amount of character and creativity making each adobe home very personalized and meaningful to the homeowner. Yet, as we have learned, no picture or home is perfect as the government enforces that 40 hours a week of work is required on the homes. CR was thankfully able to knock down that number to 25 with the addition and success of volunteer hours. However, asking homeowners to spend 25 hours a week on their homes on top of regular employment hours, and daily personal needs is difficult for many people and families within the CR program. Fortunately, volunteers such as ourselves can dedicate our hours spent on site to families and homeowners who struggle to meet the weekly commitment. Each hour of volunteer work is one more hour a homeowner can sleep, eat, spend time with loved ones and feel the care and empathy of the CR community. \nOnce on site we were all immediately put to work in three different groups tackling different tasks. I and 4 others worked for 6 hours sanding and staining wood. Our site leader AJ and all of the other CR volunteers welcomed us with open arms and made working on site feel joyful, exciting and productive. At one point while Ella and I were staining wood we watched as a school bus pulled up to the neighborhood and dropped off three young children bouncing with their large backpacks. Ella and I watched silently as they headed down the sidewalk to their homes. Whether they were off to a CR home or not it still put into perspective the impact just 6 hours of staining wood can have on getting a family one step closer to having a secure roof over their heads. Beyond just the safe and sustainable practices within the CR program and construction, the homes create a community of their own: an opportunity to show and educate people on what truly makes a home - the blood, sweat, tears, and love that is spread with each helping hand. [For more information on CR see (1)] \nWhen returning to the idea of what attributes qualify a home I find myself reflecting on my Mountain Classroom experience and how we as our own community have formulated this home. The physical core of our home starts with Deb and her undoubtedly large character and personality. She contains our absurd number of hats hanging from the ceiling like colorful ornaments, whiteboards with both inspirational and hilariously irrelevant quotes, and plastic bins under our seats holding the contents of our daily needs. And lastly, of course the stains and neon duct tape holding our seats together through the color. Each attribute has evolved to give us a sense of comfort just like the adobe homes. However, on a more figurative level our home on Mountain Classroom is what it is due to each and every member. Every friendship, hug, and conversation are what formulates our home creating a stronger four walls than any other piece of wood or cement could create. Every day is an opportunity on our home site to construct and nail in our community, and for that I am grateful. \n[1] Another motivational aspect that CR embodies is their mission and commitment to leveling the playing field. Construction is typically a male dominated space, therefore CR is consistently empowering women and girls to step into the construction world. It is a powerful thing to explore the world of building and CR wants to give more people that opportunity. With each internship that CR offers half of the spots are reserved for women to prioritize those who without CR wouldn’t get to explore their construction interest. As a female myself, it was very enlightening and refreshing to see so many female construction workers on site and speak to many female designers and engineers in the Moab office. \nElla ‘23: Finding Presence\nThe day before our first expedition we spent hours packing and preparing ourselves for the next five days on the Colorado River. Towards the end of evening meeting that night, we were told we would need to choose an angel card. The purpose of the card was to direct the upcoming adventure. I began to panic that I wouldn't find the, “right,” card and my first expedition would be ruined before it began. As the cards were laid out in the dim light of the fire box, a specific word instantly caught my eye: presence. Although we had only been on Mountain Classroom for a week I was well aware of my inability to live in the present. I constantly found myself thinking about what my family might be doing in that moment across the country. \nWhile on expedition I made it my goal to focus on absolutely nothing but the present. Sounds simple, right? Wrong. Without a doubt I struggled at first but then came to the realization I was trying way too hard on something that should come naturally. Once I began to try less (only a little though!) I began enjoying the little things I otherwise may have never even noticed. My only focus was on where I was and what I was doing in that moment. I was able to shift my focus towards all the beautiful details of the Colorado River.\nWhat I didn’t realize until weeks later was that these cards may have only been directed towards one expedition, but they would carry on through all of Mountain Classroom. For each expedition we had the same routine. The night before, each person chose a card. They would then share why and how they would achieve it within their own guidelines. No one was held accountable by others but instead by themselves. This was the case for most things on Mountain. I will admit as a result of little guidance there have been many mistakes made in the past two months, but they have only led to learning experiences and growth as individuals and as a group. With our final expedition (and first without instructors) coming up in two days, I look forward to choosing our final angel cards. \nCheck out more photos from Mountain Classroom HERE.",

Read two remarkable reflections from Olivia '23 and Ella '23 below. \n\n![Proctor Academy Mountain Classroom Spring 2023](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1684083812/proctoracademyorg/vohs4l8a28lrvrdvgyxs/IMG_6291.jpg)\n\n### Olivia '23: Defining \"Home\"\n\nWhat defines a home? This has been a question many of us have grappled with on Mountain Classroom, yet recently we were all introduced to another new and different definition of the word home. Just like we have adapted to our lovely bus, Deb, as our current home, Community Rebuilds (CR) in Moab is changing the picture of how people envision a home, as well as the construction process. \n\n![Proctor Academy Mountain Classroom Spring 2023](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1684083785/proctoracademyorg/t0xy3of2gfbwjwnrywf3/IMG_6101.jpg)\n\nOn April 19th we were given the amazing opportunity to volunteer and help build an adobe home on one of CR’s work sites. The CR mission is all about creating safe, affordable, and sustainable housing changing the way people view and perceive house construction. As soon as we stepped onto the work site I was immediately blown away with the dedication and commitment to creating a more sustainable and sheltered future for so many homeowners. The homes hold an immense amount of character and creativity making each adobe home very personalized and meaningful to the homeowner. Yet, as we have learned, no picture or home is perfect as the government enforces that 40 hours a week of work is required on the homes. CR was thankfully able to knock down that number to 25 with the addition and success of volunteer hours. However, asking homeowners to spend 25 hours a week on their homes on top of regular employment hours, and daily personal needs is difficult for many people and families within the CR program. Fortunately, volunteers such as ourselves can dedicate our hours spent on site to families and homeowners who struggle to meet the weekly commitment. Each hour of volunteer work is one more hour a homeowner can sleep, eat, spend time with loved ones and feel the care and empathy of the CR community.  \n\nOnce on site we were all immediately put to work in three different groups tackling different tasks.  I and 4 others worked for 6 hours sanding and staining wood.  Our site leader AJ and all of the other CR volunteers welcomed us with open arms and made working on site feel joyful, exciting and productive.  At one point while Ella and I were staining wood we watched as a school bus pulled up to the neighborhood and dropped off three young children bouncing with their large backpacks.  Ella and I watched silently as they headed down the sidewalk to their homes.  Whether they were off to a CR home or not it still put into perspective the impact just 6 hours of staining wood can have on getting a family one step closer to having a secure roof over their heads. Beyond just the safe and sustainable practices within the CR program and construction, the homes create a community of their own: an opportunity to show and educate people on what truly makes a home - the blood, sweat, tears, and love that is spread with each helping hand. \\[For more information on CR see (1)\\] \n\n![Proctor Academy Mountain Classroom Spring 2023](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1684083754/proctoracademyorg/xlhybvg4f0o1vqtydhtc/IMG_6311.jpg)\n\nWhen returning to the idea of what attributes qualify a home I find myself reflecting on my Mountain Classroom experience and how we as our own community have formulated this home. The physical core of our home starts with Deb and her undoubtedly large character and personality. She contains our absurd number of hats hanging from the ceiling like colorful ornaments, whiteboards with both inspirational and hilariously irrelevant quotes, and plastic bins under our seats holding the contents of our daily needs. And lastly, of course the stains and neon duct tape holding our seats together through the color. Each attribute has evolved to give us a sense of comfort just like the adobe homes. However, on a more figurative level our home on Mountain Classroom is what it is due to each and every member. Every friendship, hug, and conversation are what formulates our home creating a stronger four walls than any other piece of wood or cement could create.  Every day is an opportunity on our home site to construct and nail in our community, and for that I am grateful.  \n\n\\[1\\] Another motivational aspect that CR embodies is their mission and commitment to leveling the playing field.  Construction is typically a male dominated space, therefore CR is consistently empowering women and girls to step into the construction world.  It is a powerful thing to explore the world of building and CR wants to give more people that opportunity.  With each internship that CR offers half of the spots are reserved for women to prioritize those who without CR wouldn’t get to explore their construction interest.  As a female myself, it was very enlightening and refreshing to see so many female construction workers on site and speak to many female designers and engineers in the Moab office.  \n\n![Proctor Academy Mountain Classroom Spring 2023](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1684083699/proctoracademyorg/bb3apiybijcivsas3qni/IMG_6134.jpg)\n\n### Ella ‘23: Finding Presence\n\nThe day before our first expedition we spent hours packing and preparing ourselves for the next five days on the Colorado River. Towards the end of evening meeting that night, we were told we would need to choose an angel card. The purpose of the card was to direct the upcoming adventure. I began to panic that I wouldn't find the, “right,” card and my first expedition would be ruined before it began. As the cards were laid out in the dim light of the fire box, a specific word instantly caught my eye: presence. Although we had only been on Mountain Classroom for a week I was well aware of my inability to live in the present. I constantly found myself thinking about what my family might be doing in that moment across the country. \n\nWhile on expedition I made it my goal to focus on absolutely nothing but the present. Sounds simple, right? Wrong. Without a doubt I struggled at first but then came to the realization I was trying way too hard on something that should come naturally. Once I began to try less (only a little though!) I began enjoying the little things I otherwise may have never even noticed. My only focus was on where I was and what I was doing in that moment. I was able to shift my focus towards all the beautiful details of the Colorado River.\n\n![Proctor Academy Mountain Classroom Spring 2023](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1684083728/proctoracademyorg/kj8n3qbabgrvgpa6szqb/IMG_6225.jpg)\n\nWhat I didn’t realize until weeks later was that these cards may have only been directed towards one expedition, but they would carry on through all of Mountain Classroom. For each expedition we had the same routine. The night before, each person chose a card. They would then share why and how they would achieve it within their own guidelines. No one was held accountable by others but instead by themselves. This was the case for most things on Mountain. I will admit as a result of little guidance there have been many mistakes made in the past two months, but they have only led to learning experiences and growth as individuals and as a group. With our final expedition (and first without instructors) coming up in two days, I look forward to choosing our final angel cards. \n\nCheck out more photos from Mountain Classroom [HERE](https://www.flickr.com/photos/proctoracademy/albums/72177720307205110)."

There was lots of excitement in the group even though most of us felt like we were sleepwalking. The eagerness to get to where we were going took away from the fact that it was 4:00 am. Now, you're probably wondering where we were going at 4:00 am.\nWe were in Moab, Utah where we were staying for a week, which is the longest we have stayed somewhere throughout all of Mountain so far. Since we had so much time we wanted to do everything. Going to see Delicate Arch in Arches National Park was something we all decided we had to do.

After a few people did some good convincing we finally decided to do it. \nI’m telling this story because this is by far one of my favorite memories from Mountain Classroom. Our whole group coming together to wake up super early to go hike to watch the sunrise, at one of the most famous national geologic wonders, was something I will never forget. \nComing out of the dark and walking around the corner of the rocky cliffs, everyone was amazed at what they were looking at. Standing tall in front of an amazing view was the Delicate Arch. The natural red colored rock formation in the shape of, well you guessed it, an arch. We all went and found spots to sit and take it all in. As we watched the sun come up, more and more people started to arrive. I was surprised by how many people had the same idea as us to wake up early to come watch the sunrise at the arch, although I also wasn’t, due to how amazing this place is. \nEverything about that morning was amazing. If you haven’t been to Delicate Arch in Moab, then you should be putting it on your bucket list right now! I’m telling you- it’s not too bad of a place. \nCheck out more photos from Mountain Classroom Spring 2023!",

  "text": "Proctor Academy's Mountain Classroom program wrapped up its winter trimester studying in the American Southwest with a student-led expedition. Read more about these final weeks of the term from Zoie '24 and Mountain Instructor Caleb in this week's blog post. \nStudent Led Expedition - Perspective: The Water Bottles We All Use \nOn February 12th, the students all set off from the trailhead into the vast Superstition Mountains, us water bottles placed carefully in the holders of our heavy packs, ready to head out into the student-led expedition. Out here in the desert, you may think it is tough to fill us up and keep us filled while in the backcountry, and while that is true in some ways, it is incredibly important that all of us bottles were being used frequently and generously, as the hot sun beat down on each of the students backs and necks. \nBefore we set off on our great adventure, each of us were filled to the brim as well as our “older cousin” bottles… the good old trusty (leaky) droms. Each student carried a 10 liter drom filled with water in their packs, trusting that when that water ran out, we would find river water that we would then collect in our droms and bottles for our travels. The first day we set off later than expected, with a beautiful sunset coating the ridge lines. Each student hiked briskly, with no real instruction or guidance. For the first time out on expedition, the students really felt on their own. Us water bottles were a little bummed to only be used a few times on this evening hike, due to the fact we went a speedy three miles to our camp for the night. The LOD (leader of the day) and Navigator worked together to pick a lovely campsite flush with fresh grass from the previous days of heavy rain. Us bottles were definitely used that night to make some delicious dinners on the whisper light backcountry stoves. \nThe next day was a big one for us bottles. We began a much longer day, but with full bottles for all students (using the droms) they were off and equipped to tackle any challenge ahead of them. Once again the navigator with their map in hand, and the LOD ready to assist if necessary led us out of camp, continuing North-East into the Superstition mountains. We arrived at our first river, and crossed it with ease as well as some ambivalence. While some jumped right in and even took a swim in the chilly rapids, others balanced on rocks to thoughtfully get across without compromising their dry socks and shoes. While this river crossing was the first major crossing of this day, it sure was not the last. The rest of the day consisted of trudging through refreshing rivers to get to the other side and continue on our trail. When lunch time rolled around, we all stopped on a beautiful, smooth rock face overlooking yet another rapidly flowing river, and finally the students whipped out us water bottles that were now, about empty, to refill from mother nature's source. \nThe students filled each of us up with cold river water. However lovely the river water was in each of the bottles, unfortunately the students could not just drink it straight. The students pulled out their aquamira, and purified the water so it was safe to drink. After a combination of numbers of drops and different solutions and waiting time for it to resonate in us bottles, we were good to go and couldn't wait for the students to start using us again!\nThe following days of the student led expedition looked different (and similar) every day. While each day we would hike approximately 5 miles to a different location, set up camp and then make dinner, hang out and evening meeting would commence before a night of sleeping under the stars, we never crossed over the same land twice, and each day us water bottles just coming along for the ride saw something new each day. We nourished the students and were utilized quite frequently on the hot hot days hiking miles with thousands of feet in elevation. On the fourth day of hiking, some folks found some wigglys in their bottles from the river, even after disseminating the purifying solution. While some folks didn't mind this presence, others stretched Zoies shirt over the mouths of their bottles to strain the water. Us bottles thought this process was a great solution and worked extremely well. Each night, many students would place us by their heads or their feet of their sleeping bags, and we were all thrilled with this decision because usually we are in tents and have a stitched webbing between us and the glowing moon and stars. However, during the student led expedition, while tents were packed and brought, everyone decided to “cowboy camp” every single night. Cowboy camping means to sleep just on the group with your mat and your bag, no tent. Each night, the students placed their sleeping bags tightly knit to one another, like cans of sardines. \nUs bottles watched from the packs as the Mountain group chatted with other hiking groups along their way. We watched as Caleb found people in the Superstitions that he knew from Vermont!! Us bottles watched from the packs as the students worked together through challenges like picking out a campsite, deciding when to keep hiking, planning the entire course of the day, managing risk assessments and other logistical decisions. Us water bottles, just sitting in the packs along for the ride, were proud of the growth we saw in each and every student. What they did was certainly not easy, and while we wish there was more we could do than provide their H20, us water bottles will always be down for another adventure; especially with this group. \nWinter Count: Perspective of the Drum Circle\nThis year at Winter Count, I saw a new group of folks enter into this community, and us drums were excited and intrigued to understand who they were and where they came from. Dressed slightly differently than the other Winter Count community members, we saw this group of nine high-schoolers walk into the main camp on February 18th, wide eyed and full of zeal for the week ahead. We could tell just by looking at them on the first day; their expressions and curiosity bursting that these nine would explore this gathering and all it has to offer with curiosity towards all people and their stories, skills, and livelihood. We also recognized that they may have been slightly uncomfortable about being around 600 people after many days removed from large crowds. During the first opening circle on Sunday, they all arrived ready to listen and engage with the opening of the gathering. \nThroughout the week, us drums stayed put in the general area of “main camp” (the central location at Winter Count). We watched every morning as they arrived promptly to morning meeting, ready to hear announcements and anecdotes about the day just begun. I also noticed many of the nine mysterious high-schoolers going to different classes consistently, and working diligently on each of their projects. We saw down the path three boys working on making their very own bows. We saw them work hard and thoughtfully, putting in many hours and maintaining a high level of focus and diligence throughout the entire time. Right across the way we saw some other students and very frequently an instructor, in the flint knapping “pit” working on the skill of flint knapping. We saw four girls working very hard, over multiple long days on beaded bracelets for themselves or as gifts for loved ones. We saw a student perform an original song he wrote in front of over a hundred people. We saw many vibrant rows of people lined up for delicious food, and outstanding warm teas. We were used, everyday, by many different people. We saw many of the students dance while people beat us and cultivated a harmonious sound of singing and drumming. We saw many fires central to our setup. We saw the students engaging in many meaningful conversations throughout the week, and we saw them fostering new relationships with those of all ages and backgrounds. We saw them excited to learn, and happy to extend their knowledge. Us drums saw the students making gourd bowls, whittling spoons, welding metal ladles, creating custom moccasin shoes, and so much more. Us drums were thoroughly impressed and pleased with the presence and engagement of this mysterious high school group had with Winter Count. We hope they enjoyed our consistent sound throughout the days and we hope each of the individuals considers returning to this unique place in years to come. \nThe past two weeks have seen the Mountain Classroom group move beyond the delineation of students and instructors as the group began to achieve new levels of independence through tackling more and more of the logistics of Mountain. With the bulk of their school work behind them, students leapt at the chance to plan their own backcountry experience in the superstition mountains. Through practicing the use of risk management models, planning rations and creating navigation plans, I saw everyone take a level of ownership over their Mountain experience we have not seen yet. As Uncle Ben (or Aunt May) might say, with great power comes great responsibility. On this backpacking trip I was impressed by how students took on the new responsibilities of navigating both the physical and emotional landscape of being in remote places doing hard work. Moving on from the backcountry and into Winter Count, our last experience this term, I saw everyone take a further step in responsible independence. \nLet me set the scene. In the heart of the Sonoran Desert, in a valley covered in Saguaro, Creosote Bush, Prickly Pear and Barrel cacti, there is a place called “The Boulders” so called because of the majestic granite boulders that tower over the surrounding desert. Every year, six hundred people gather here and spend a week learning traditional living and survival skills. It could have been so easy for our students to take the freedom of choosing their own workshops and classes everyday to disengage with Mountain and Winter Count and miss out on learning all these skills and meeting new people. I was frankly floored with how excited folks got about all the projects and classes available. Brooke, Molly, Thea, and Zoie tackled a complex beading project while Devon preferred blacksmithing. Charlie, Owen, and Willem built long bows and Miles spent the week working on different types of archaic jewelry. Each day I would hear new stories of excitement, see new projects completed, meet new friends and play new games. Now, I watch as all the students laugh themselves silly as they finish packing and set up their pads and bags for a final sleep under the stars. \nCheck out more photos from Mountain Classroom 2024!",
  "markdown": "Proctor Academy's Mountain Classroom program wrapped up its winter trimester studying in the American Southwest with a student-led expedition. Read more about these final weeks of the term from Zoie '24 and Mountain Instructor Caleb in this week's blog post. \n\n![Mountain Classroom Student Led Expedition](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1709565464/proctoracademyorg/jud7dgacbnz3rikka7sm/image4_1.jpg)\n\n## Student Led Expedition - Perspective: The Water Bottles We All Use \n\nOn February 12th, the students all set off from the trailhead into the vast Superstition Mountains, us water bottles placed carefully in the holders of our heavy packs, ready to head out into the student-led expedition. Out here in the desert, you may think it is tough to fill us up and keep us filled while in the backcountry, and while that is true in some ways, it is incredibly important that all of us bottles were being used frequently and generously, as the hot sun beat down on each of the students backs and necks. \n\nBefore we set off on our great adventure, each of us were filled to the brim as well as our “older cousin” bottles… the good old trusty (leaky) droms. Each student carried a 10 liter drom filled with water in their packs, trusting that when that water ran out, we would find river water that we would then collect in our droms and bottles for our travels. The first day we set off later than expected, with a beautiful sunset coating the ridge lines. Each student hiked briskly, with no real instruction or guidance. For the first time out on expedition, the students really felt on their own. Us water bottles were a little bummed to only be used a few times on this evening hike, due to the fact we went a speedy three miles to our camp for the night. The LOD (leader of the day) and Navigator worked together to pick a lovely campsite flush with fresh grass from the previous days of heavy rain. Us bottles were definitely used that night to make some delicious dinners on the whisper light backcountry stoves. \n\nThe next day was a big one for us bottles. We began a much longer day, but with full bottles for all students (using the droms) they were off and equipped to tackle any challenge ahead of them. Once again the navigator with their map in hand, and the LOD ready to assist if necessary led us out of camp, continuing North-East into the Superstition mountains. We arrived at our first river, and crossed it with ease as well as some ambivalence. While some jumped right in and even took a swim in the chilly rapids, others balanced on rocks to thoughtfully get across without compromising their dry socks and shoes. While this river crossing was the first major crossing of this day, it sure was not the last. The rest of the day consisted of trudging through refreshing rivers to get to the other side and continue on our trail. When lunch time rolled around, we all stopped on a beautiful, smooth rock face overlooking yet another rapidly flowing river, and finally the students whipped out us water bottles that were now, about empty, to refill from mother nature's source. \n\n![Mountain Classroom Student Led Expedition](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1709565484/proctoracademyorg/k3xhqah2lwaxy2y1gvia/image5_1.jpg)\n\nThe students filled each of us up with cold river water. However lovely the river water was in each of the bottles, unfortunately the students could not just drink it straight. The students pulled out their aquamira, and purified the water so it was safe to drink. After a combination of numbers of drops and different solutions and waiting time for it to resonate in us bottles, we were good to go and couldn't wait for the students to start using us again!\n\nThe following days of the student led expedition looked different (and similar) every day. While each day we would hike approximately 5 miles to a different location, set up camp and then make dinner, hang out and evening meeting would commence before a night of sleeping under the stars, we never crossed over the same land twice, and each day us water bottles just coming along for the ride saw something new each day. We nourished the students and were utilized quite frequently on the hot hot days hiking miles with thousands of feet in elevation. On the fourth day of hiking, some folks found some wigglys in their bottles from the river, even after disseminating the purifying solution. While some folks didn't mind this presence, others stretched Zoies shirt over the mouths of their bottles to strain the water. Us bottles thought this process was a great solution and worked extremely well. Each night, many students would place us by their heads or their feet of their sleeping bags, and we were all thrilled with this decision because usually we are in tents and have a stitched webbing between us and the glowing moon and stars. However, during the student led expedition, while tents were packed and brought, everyone decided to “cowboy camp” every single night. Cowboy camping means to sleep just on the group with your mat and your bag, no tent. Each night, the students placed their sleeping bags tightly knit to one another, like cans of sardines. \n\nUs bottles watched from the packs as the Mountain group chatted with other hiking groups along their way. We watched as Caleb found people in the Superstitions that he knew from Vermont!! Us bottles watched from the packs as the students worked together through  challenges like picking out a campsite, deciding when to keep hiking, planning the entire course of the day, managing risk assessments and other logistical decisions. Us water bottles, just sitting in the packs along for the ride, were proud  of the growth we saw in each and every student. What they did was certainly not easy, and while we wish there was more we could do than provide their H20, us water bottles will always be down for another adventure; especially with this group. \n\n![Mountain Classroom Student Led Expedition](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1709565554/proctoracademyorg/ljvwkp7intnxer1qjsqq/image2_1.jpg)\n\n## Winter Count: Perspective of the Drum Circle\n\nThis year at Winter Count, I saw a new group of folks enter into this community, and us drums were excited and intrigued to understand who they were and where they came from.

  "text": "Welcome to Mountain Classroom’s fourth biweekly blog! In this post, we are covering January 30th to February 10th. We last left off around Adjunct Weekend, where the cool aunts Annie and Patty flew all the way to Vegas to visit us, and now we are in the time directly after. We jumped back into our adventures with Emi and Caleb first with an unexpected day of rock climbing, bringing our total days of climbing up to six! Our next few days were entirely spent driving, the night of the 31st being spent in tents on the side of the road. Van Go had a rough time on our way to Cascabel, Arizona, especially as we approached the site of our sojourn, the infamous Mountain Solos. Van Go weaved around and went up and over many hills, leaving that roller coaster feeling in the pits of our stomachs. After our adventures on the road, we unloaded and frantically grabbed clothes and guitars before trekking down to “base camp.” We spent the night there, enjoying the amenities of the lovely composting toilet and the kitchen with collected rainwater! \nIn this next section, I would like to spend some time on the mental effects from solos, with questions answered by our very own Brooke and Devon! Welcome to our Solo Q/A: \nWhat day was the hardest for you?\nBrooke ~ I would say the hardest day for me was the 4th, around the middle of the solo. I was constantly thinking about the amount of days and nights I had left, and that I was only halfway. It was hard mentally because I knew how long the days felt, and I also knew how many more I had left.\nDevon ~ The hardest day for me was the very first night. It was strange to be away from people after so much time of being around a group day to day, and alongside that, there was a huge hail/rainstorm that was keeping me up all night.\nScariest part of solos?\nBrooke ~ Honestly, the evenings were definitely the scariest for me. During the daytime, I would distract myself with reading a lot and writing letters, but something about the time when I was waiting for the sun to go fully down so I could go to bed was scary. And, it was weird because when I got into my sleeping bag I was totally fine.\nDevon ~ I had a special guest hanging around with me every night, a coyote kept hanging out around 50 feet from my tent every night and it kept me up for hours.\nBest part of solos?\nBrooke ~ My favorite part of solos was when I was cleaning up my mailbox, and I could hear many of my friends walking closer towards me. After we met up, it was so fun exchanging stories of our solos, and also so exciting to reunite with Caleb and Emi.\nDevon ~ My favorite part of solos was definitely walking the ridgeline around my site. Being able to just go up and sit there for hours without any disruption was so serene and beautiful.\nMost fun you had?\nBrooke ~ Honestly, reuniting with everyone and sharing our stories!\nDevon ~ I would say that reuniting with everyone was the most fun I had as well!\nDid you write at all?\nBrooke ~ I wrote many, many letters to a lot of my family and friends, along with some to a couple members of the group. I also made sure to write in my journal everyday, even though I was basically doing the same thing everyday.\nDevon ~ I did a little bit of writing on my solos. I wrote some in my journal but I mostly wrote letters and started doing some creative writing but dropped it before the last day.\nDid you do any art?\nBrooke ~ Surprisingly, no! Besides the small drawings I do at the end of every journal entry in my Write In The Rain.\nDevon ~ I was tasked by a family member to do some drawing while on my solos, so I did a decent amount of landscape drawings and spent a lot of time with my camera, just taking pictures of really anything I saw that looked interesting to me and then later going back and deleting the ones that weren’t good.\nBack to the regular schedule of events…\nAfter we all rejoined at base camp on our final morning of solos, we boarded Van Go (finally!) and set off up a very large hill. Van Go took home the win, and the hill was left defeated. We were then surprised by an amazing, warm brunch cooked up by the wonderful people at the Cascabel Community Center. We loaded up on pancakes, cookies, egg scramble, sausage, and APPLE JUICE! \nNext, we set out on our next trek to our newest campsite, right near Roosevelt Lake and a very large dam. Funny story, the road to our campsite was closed due to flooding, so we turned around and headed back to Oak Flat Campground. We spent a very rainy night there, before packing up the next day and heading to a replacement campsite near our original one, but with SHOWERS and RUNNING WATER TOILETS! Finally, we had made it: finals week was here. \nAt Windy Hill Campground, we spent a week working hard on all of our final projects, including nature sits, masterclasses, social studies presentations, etc. This week was also very wet, as it poured pretty much everyday. The showers were somewhat disappointing, as they were push-button ones and also just didn’t get very warm. It also wasn’t that helpful that when you left the shower, you would just go back out into the rain and the cold. Any moment of sun we had was an amazing gift! Near the end of the week, after many, many hours of working hard, we got to sit out in the sun and also enjoy some frisbee. Along with the sun arriving, we also arrived on a VERY important day: Super Bowl Sunday!!! \nAfter many of our group members had complained about missing football, we drew a chaos card calling a GAME DAY! Our instructors were finally convinced, so we set out with our backcountry stoves to cook up some dang-dangs, and our layers. We set up at a nearby picnic spot, right on the same lake not even a couple of miles down the road. But, this picnic place had service, and a gorgeous view of the sunset. Miles and Zoie got cooking, and we all huddled around the Mountain computer to watch the game, (Thanks Mrs. Romm!) and also the halftime show. After a very successful night, we headed back to catch up on sleep. Overall, it was a great way to end a very productive finals week on Mountain, winter 2023-2024!\nMountain Hot Takes\nWe close out this blog post with our version of Mountain Hot Takes. For those of you who don’t know, Hot Takes are opinions that are possibly controversial, and we often share our Hot Takes during evening meetings or periodically throughout the days. Here’s some from each person about solos and final project week:\nDevon ~ Final projects were…kinda fun?\nMolly ~ I should have brought a real tent on my solo…\nMiles ~ The push button showers were not as bad as people said they were…\nCharlie ~ Schoolwork isn’t over, even after finals week…\nOwen ~ Handwriting homework is better than typing on a computer…\nZoie ~ Cowboy camping is better than using a backcountry tent…\nWillem ~ Bus and trailer blowouts are kinda fun…\nThea ~ Birkenstocks are the only footwear you need on Mountain\nBrooke ~ Eating peanut butter out of the jar on solos was the superior snack…\nEmi ~ If a story is done well in a book or a movie, there’s no such thing as spoilers…\nCaleb ~ If you always eat your best food first, you are always eating your best food…\nThanks for reading, \nBrooke '25 and Devon '25 \nCheck out more photos from Mountain Classroom on Flickr!",

Along with the sun arriving, we also arrived on a VERY important day: Super Bowl Sunday!!! \n\nAfter many of our group members had complained about missing football, we drew a chaos card calling a GAME DAY! Our instructors were finally convinced, so we set out with our backcountry stoves to cook up some dang-dangs, and our layers. We set up at a nearby picnic spot, right on the same lake not even a couple of miles down the road. But, this picnic place had service, and a gorgeous view of the sunset. Miles and Zoie got cooking, and we all huddled around the Mountain computer to watch the game, (Thanks Mrs. Romm!) and also the halftime show. After a very successful night, we headed back to catch up on sleep. Overall, it was a great way to end a very productive finals week on Mountain, winter 2023-2024!\n\n![Proctor Academy Mountain Classroom](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1709145760/proctoracademyorg/ixypbewebq5hldwxds3h/image5.jpg)\n\n## Mountain Hot Takes\n\nWe close out this blog post with our version of Mountain Hot Takes. For those of you who don’t know, Hot Takes are opinions that are possibly controversial, and we often share our Hot Takes during evening meetings or periodically throughout the days. Here’s some from each person about solos and final project week:\n\nDevon ~ Final projects were…kinda fun?  \nMolly ~ I should have brought a real tent on my solo…  \nMiles ~ The push button showers were not as bad as people said they were…  \nCharlie ~ Schoolwork isn’t over, even after finals week…  \nOwen ~ Handwriting homework is better than typing on a computer…  \nZoie ~ Cowboy camping is better than using a backcountry tent…  \nWillem ~ Bus and trailer blowouts are kinda fun…  \nThea ~ Birkenstocks are the only footwear you need on Mountain  \nBrooke ~ Eating peanut butter out of the jar on solos was the superior snack…  \nEmi ~ If a story is done well in a book or a movie, there’s no such thing as spoilers…  \nCaleb ~ If you always eat your best food first, you are always eating your best food…\n\nThanks for reading, \n\nBrooke '25 and Devon '25 \n\n## [Check out more photos from Mountain Classroom on Flickr!](https://www.flickr.com/photos/proctoracademy/albums/72177720313493697/)"

  "text": "As Proctor Academy's Mountain Classroom program continues their adventure throughout the American Southwest, students share reflections on three different expeditions. Hop vicariously aboard the Mountain Classroom bus in today's blog update from Thea '24, Owen '24, Molly '24, and Willem '24! \nThea ‘24 and Owen ‘24 \nOur stiff, sleepy bodies stepped foot off the plane. Once greeted with Emi’s enthusiastic grin across the airport, Caleb pulled Van Go (the name of our Mountain bus) up to the side of the road and we all hopped in; high spirits all around. After about an hour's drive, Van Go pulled into Buc-ee’s, the grandest gas station any of us had ever seen. Our parking lot pb&j lunch took place here. The air was humid, and the sun was beaming; a feeling we never quite felt during our Vermont portion of the trip. From there, we drove to Durant, OK, where we camped for two nights.\nWe spent our first day at the Ahni Center, where we learned about the harrowing work they do intervening with children, adolescents and adults in abusive and harmful situations. We were all deeply moved learning about the systems and processes in place to help Indigenous people in trouble. We also went to the Choctaw Tribal court where we got an in-depth tour of the facilities. Furthermore, we went to the Choctaw Cultural Center where we explored the in depth beauty of the history and culture of the Choctaw Nation. Additionally, we indulged in some traditional cuisine and all joined together for an ultimate frisbee game in the Center’s fields. \nThe next morning we arose to the wake up call from our LOD (Leader of the day) whom was myself, and packed up our belongings to head towards our next campground. We traveled long and far to get to the western border of Texas where we would sleep for one night before making our next stretch to New Mexico. At the crack of dawn, we woke up and made our way west. By surprise, we were then blessed with a stop in Santa Fe, where we enjoyed Mexican food, local art and jewelry shops, and for some, new cowboy hats. We concluded the day with a short drive to our next camping location outside of Santa Fe, where we were pleasantly surprised with heated cabins and showers. One could say this was Glamping. After an extremely restful and rejuvenating night of sleep, the next morning we got on the road and drove our next long leg to the Gila Wilderness. \nApproximately mid-drive, a series of unfortunate events started to occur. Just outside of a little quaint town in the midst of the enchanting, vast mountains of New Mexico, we vaguely heard and felt the sudden pop of the front left tire. Emi got out to assess the damage as Caleb and Zoie frantically scurried around town querying locals for service in order to make a call to Triple A. Once we figured out it would take several hours for an expert to arrive, we decided to make the most of our newly carved in time, and got to work distributing and packing food for our adventure in the Gila. Finally, help arrived, our tire was changed, and we prepared ourselves for our last few hours on the road. Of course, in our luck for that day, Caleb mistakenly stepped on a cactus that spiked straight through the sole of his shoe and into his foot. This inevitably halted us yet again, however Caleb promptly took care of his medical needs that were necessary to help our group as a whole make our way to the Gila Wilderness. About an hour into the drive, it began to snow heavily; we stopped for gas and put chains on the tires. The chains took about 30 minutes to install, Caleb, Willem and Zoie tackled that challenge. Once we left, of course, within 2 minutes, we all heard the lurking sound of one of the chains breaking. Caleb jumped out, took it fully off, and we kept on cruising up & down the long and windy road to Upper Scorpion Campground with hail viciously blowing in our windshield. Our extravaganza of a day finally came to an end, and we safely arrived.\nOur initial plans were to front-country camp there for a night, then begin our lengthy 10 days of backcountry camping the next. However, this plan unexpectedly shifted as a harsh wave of sickness overcame some of us in the group. Over the next few days, those who were feeling ill stayed behind, while the others explored the serene landscape through day hikes. Some of those explorations even turned into off-trail scrambles; scrambles that were indeed quite unexpectedly challenging. We ended our leisurely time in the Gila with a much needed visit to a local hot spring; we let out sighs of relief as our skin absorbed the hot water.\nThe following morning, the mundane yet exhilarating activity of waking up at the crack of dawn and packing up camp occurred yet again. We swiftly deconstructed our tents, heated up some warm and easily cleanable bowls of oatmeal, and began our journey to Oak Flat Campground in Queen Creek, AZ for our rock climbing portion of Mountain. \nMolly ‘25\nAfter a week of sickness in the Gila the group was excited to venture onto Queen Creek and begin our climbing adventure. Everyone had different experience levels when it came to climbing. For some it was the first time ever attempting it, but others have had previous time on rocks. For me I have been climbing on and off throughout my entire life. When I was younger rock climbing scared me. Despite always having a rope to catch me I hated falling and would always stick to climbs I knew I could easily do. As I got older I kept playing it safe and doing what I knew I could. \nThe first day of climbing felt familiar as we started with some easier climbs to ease the group into climbing. Emi or Caleb would lead climb up, set the route and the rest of us would top rope climb it. As I talked to Caleb about my rock climbing experience he asked me if I would be interested in learning how to lead climb. Lead climbing is a type of climbing where instead of having a rope coming down from the top you clip into carabiners on the wall as you climb up. When top rope climbing you only fall a couple feet at most. Lead climbing falls can be much farther and much scarier. Despite how much I hated falling even on top rope I had always wanted to try lead climbing, so I told Caleb I wanted to learn. \nTo begin learning the skills for lead climbing we started with mock leading. Charlie and I both were determined to learn how to lead climb so we started mock leading our climbs. Mock leading is when you still have a rope from above keeping you safe, but you have a second rope that you clip into the wall as you climb so you can learn the motions of lead climbing. Mock lead climbing is fun because you get to experience lead climbing without the risk of actually falling. The scary part of mock leading though is everytime you make a mistake you wonder what if I was really lead climbing? Every slip and misstep becomes ten times more nerve racking as you realize that soon the rope keeping you secure would be gone. \nEven when I wasn't mock leading I could feel my rock climbing skills improving. With the help of my climbing mentor Emi, I learned to trust myself and the safety measures in place. The group began to take on harder and harder climbs. Holds became smaller and footholds turned to smearing the rock. Each climb I grew more confident and began to feel more comfortable taking risks. On our final day of rock climbing the time was finally here. We returned to the climbing spot from our first day, Lower Looner Land. With one final mock lead I ditched the top rope and prepared for my first lead climbing ascent. \nThe first part of a lead climb is the scariest and most dangerous. Until you reach the first bolt you have to free climb. Luckily for me the first bolt was only a few feet up on a relatively sloped climb so before I knew it I was clipped to the wall. I continued up the wall as I had done many times before, reaching a bolt, pulling a quickdraw from my harness, and clipping to the wall. Before I knew it I had reached the crux of the climb. Even though I had done it before this time the stakes felt much higher. I was still being kept safe by a rope, but this time a fall would be much farther. After a couple minutes being stuck by an outcropping of rock and a lack of good handholds I realized the only way up was to unsteadily send it. I pulled myself up and in a few moves was over it and only a couple feet from the top. I continued up and, without falling, finished the climb. Shaking hard from both fear of falling and tiredness from the awkward position I was standing in, I unscrewed the caribeener at the top and clipped into the anchor. Climb camp was a great opportunity for everyone to leave their comfort zones and try something new. Whether it was learning how to climb, or lead climbing, everyone in the group set and reached many goals and improved together. \nWillem ‘24\nRecently the group entered main phase, which begins to shift more and more responsibility from instructors to students. This was our first taste of that responsibility and I think we all enjoyed this next step into our Mountain experience, and are all proud of what we had to accomplish to get here. Unlike many of our other adventures off grid this one had very little to no pressure to achieve certain mileage or to go to certain sites. Which gave the group the ability to pick the challenge of our daily adventure. \nAlthough I enjoyed being outside of my comfort zone, climb camp proved itself intense for both the mind and the body; however, I was personally ready to move on to something a little more familiar. Proceeding a very long one day drive from Globe, AZ to Las Vegas, NV we began to prepare for our first and only aqua adventure. With our special guest Patty Pond it felt kinda fitting to hit the blue water of the Colorado River. Although it wasn't the Gulf of Maine I felt some of my experience shine through as paddles pushed swirling water behind our bright red canoes. \nNot only was the water below us but also coming from above as we received two lovely consecutive days of rain during the beginning of our 4 day trip. Day 1 of the Canoe trip no matter how heavy the rain was it couldn’t trump my spirits, as I was fixated on arriving at our first camp site, which had some lovely amenities like pit toilets (a bougie outhouse) and the best part of natural hot springs. With the current against us Owen and I were determined to be the first to our prospective camp and first to these infamous hot springs. Owen and I paddled hard and led the group through beautiful canyons. Little coves along the river were abundant with different species of ducks and birds, the largest flocks I had ever seen before. \nWith little sunlight left we beached our canoes and quickly set up camp, a warm stream of water trickling through the center of our camp only boosted my excitement. Before taking the short hike from camp to the hot springs some brave souls and myself took a quick cold dunk in the river before running up to experience the extreme natural warmth. \nThe summary of the canoe trip can be made up as a hot spring tour on the Colorado River as we enjoyed three different hot springs on our four day paddle up and down the winding river. On our 4th and final day I'm more excited to see our dear Van GO and begin our adjunct weekend than saddened to be leaving the river. Later that same day we said farewell to our instructors Emi and Caleb and we began a awesome weekend In Las Vegas with our “cool aunts” Patty and Annie and I'll leave you with this: what happens in Vegas Stays in Vegas. \nCheck out more photos from Mountain Classroom - Winter 2024 here!",

  "text": "Sep 8 2023 9:57 AM \nIn the fall of 1994, former faculty member David Pilla launched a trimester at sea program at Proctor called Ocean Classroom. That bold vision set the course for an evolution in Proctor’s off-campus program offerings that has since changed the lives of more than 400 Proctor alumni. The goal of the program was, and is, simple: expose high school kids to the power of living at sea while connecting their learning to the ocean, its ecosystems, and its history. Thirty years and many evolutions later, a group of 22 intrepid sailors gathered at the Sea Education Association campus in Woods Hole, MA to embark on Proctor’s 30th year of Ocean Classroom voyages. \nIn April, Proctor announced an exciting new partnership with Sea Education Association (SEA). For the past 51 years, SEA has served as a leader in sail training programs and is considered to be the gold standard in sail and ocean education at both the high school and collegiate levels. Proctor students will both spend time on SEA’s campus in Woods Hole and aboard the steel hulled 134 foot, 158 ton brigantine schooner SSV Corwith Cramer. As parents toured the ship on Thursday with SEA educators and Ocean Classroom Program Director Brooks Bicknell ‘77, they were blown away by the on-board oceanographic laboratory, accommodations, map room, and other features that will allow them to explore the Atlantic over the coming months.\nProctor has worked with SEA to design a custom program that will mirror SEA’s college programs whereby Proctor students will spend an initial portion of the term at the Woods Hole campus involved in interactive, hands-on coursework where they will build the skills in preparation for research aboard the vessel and for the voyage. The ensuing voyage will see students sailing from Woods Hole to Lunenburg, Nova Scotia where they will focus on fisheries, wildlife, and the history of whaling, before continuing on to Bermuda where they will study human impacts on climate and ocean plastics. The third leg of the voyage will see students sail from Bermuda to Charleston, focusing their studies on human movement, trafficking, and migration across oceans. The final leg of the journey will have students transit back to Woods Hole where they will finish research projects in preparation for a final symposium to be held at Proctor on November 9. \nThe program’s curriculum will be organized into two units, the first on shore at SEA’s campus in Woods Hole and the second on board the SSV Corwith Cramer. The shore component introduces students to the foundations of understanding the ocean and the history of human interactions with marine spaces and resources. Grounded with this framework for understanding major questions in oceanic studies, students will design group research topics onshore that address the questions they find most compelling. Then, by collecting samples and data aboard SEA’s oceanographic research and sailing vessel they will gather the data they need to complete their projects upon return to campus in Woods Hole before delivering their results to the broader Proctor community in a final symposium on the Proctor campus at the end of the program.\nFor the past thirty years, both Proctor and SEA have served as leaders in the sea education industry. Our paths have crossed, but never united, and we are thrilled to see how this new partnership will transform not only the experiences of this fall’s Proctor crew, but the future of at sea education for high school students. Last spring, SEA President John Wigglesworth commented, “Ocean Classroom at SEA is a partnership that, in many ways, has been in the makings for decades. I am pleased that Proctor Academy and the Sea Education Association are now shipmates.” \nOcean Classroom Program Director Brooks Bicknell ‘77 adds, “To see the confluence of Proctor’s Ocean Classroom Program and SEA’s program is remarkable. We are excited to have Kara Baird ‘20 (a 2019 Ocean Classroom alum aboard Roseway) on board as a crew member this fall and to have the ship captained by Pamela Coughlin who captained our program with Sailing Ships Maine last year and worked for SEA for fifteen years earlier in her career. Proctor and SEA’s work has been interwoven for years, and we are thrilled for this new partnership to take sail.” \nAs our students prepare to set sail, research, learn, and live their lives to the fullest, we thank SEA for their partnership and our parents for their trust in Proctor and the life-changing programs we are able to offer. Be sure to stay tuned for updates from Ocean Classroom throughout the fall trimester as students learn what the phrase Ship, Shipmates, Self truly means. \nLearn more about Proctor's Ocean Classroom Program! \nCheck out more photos from Ocean Classroom 2023!",

  "text": "Since 1994, Proctor students have studied at sea as a part of Proctor’s Ocean Classroom program. Throughout those nearly three decades, Proctor has worked with different partners, most recently Sailing Ships Maine, to deliver this life-changing off-campus program that puts students at the center of learning aboard a tall-ship. It is with great enthusiasm that Proctor announces a new partnership with Sea Education Association (SEA) out of Woods Hole, Massachusetts for the fall Ocean Classroom program. \nPhoto Courtesy of SEA\nFor the past 51 years, SEA has served as a leader in sail training programs and is considered to be the gold standard in sail and ocean education at both the high school and collegiate levels. A well connected organization that works in proximity and collaboration with Woods Hole Oceanographic and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) among other research organizations, SEA also operates the steel hulled 134 foot,158 ton brigantine schooner SSV Corwith Cramer that was built in 1987 in Bilbao, Spain. The ship is equipped with an oceanographic laboratory and powered by a 500 HP Cummins Diesel and holds an \"All Oceans\" designation for operating.\nProctor has worked with SEA to design a custom program that will mirror SEA’s college programs whereby Proctor students will spend an initial portion of the term at the Woods Hole campus involved in interactive, hands-on coursework where they will build the skills in preparation for research aboard the vessel and for the voyage. The ensuing voyage will see students sailing from Woods Hole to Lunenburg, Nova Scotia where they will focus on fisheries, wildlife, and the history of whaling, before continuing on to Bermuda where they will study human impacts on climate and ocean plastics. The third leg of the voyage will see students sail from Bermuda to Charleston, focusing their studies on human movement, trafficking, and migration across oceans. The final leg of the journey will have students transit back to Woods Hole where they will finish research projects in preparation for a final symposium to be held at Proctor on November 9. \nThe program’s curriculum will be organized into two four-week units, the first on program on shore at SEA’s campus in Woods Hole and the second on board the SSV Corwith Cramer. \nThe shore component introduces students to the foundations of understanding the ocean and the history of human interactions with marine spaces and resources. These topics are introduced in the classroom in various formats, including lectures, student-driven discussions based on assigned readings, field trips, field-based research, and lab sessions. Grounded with this framework for understanding major questions in oceanic studies, students will design group research topics onshore that address the questions they find most compelling. Then, by collecting samples and data aboard SEA’s oceanographic research and sailing vessel they will gather the data they need to complete their projects upon return to campus in Woods Hole before delivering their results to the broader Proctor community in a final symposium on the Proctor campus at the end of the program.\nOcean Classroom Director Brooks Bicknell ‘77 shares, “I am incredibly excited for our new partnership with SEA and the direction Ocean Classroom will be taking moving forward. Today, more than ever, it is critical that we all gain a deeper understanding of 324 million cubic miles of seawater or 2/3 of the earth's surface that supports and modifies the weather of our planet. SEA, with their experienced faculty and well equipped brigantine schooner SSV Corwith Cramer, will be able to best prepare and facilitate a better understanding of the ocean, its ecosystems, and the history of human interaction on and across the waters the with a voyage route that will take them from Cape Cod to Nova Scotia, Bermuda, Charleston and back to Woods Hole.” \nProctor’s Head of School Brian Thomas adds, “On the doorstep of Proctor's 30th Anniversary of Ocean Classroom, we are proud to be partnering with SEA starting in the fall. It will be a partnership that allows our students, and our school, to leverage their many years of educational programming at sea. At Proctor, we live our motto: Live to learn. Learn to Live. We wholeheartedly believe in forming good habits that impact the world; a student understands their place and responsibility in and to the world by what they repeatedly do. Our work linking Ocean Classroom with SEA will teach students to be even better stewards of the world they will inherit.\"\nSEA President John Wigglesworth reflects, “Ocean Classroom at SEA is a partnership that, in many ways, has been in the makings for decades.

En route to Mobile, Alabama to see first hand the last slave ship to arrive in America (the Clotilda) and to continue their studies on the history of involuntary servitude, injustice, and the Civil Rights Movement in America, the crew of students from Proctor and the MET High School (Providence, RI) are well on their way to becoming true sailors. Read more from their voyage below. \nHi Everyone, my name is Catherine Lugo. I’m a senior from the MET High School, and I wanted to talk about my experiences so far. We’re currently anchored in Key West but I want to talk about our journey from St. Augustine, Florida, underway, and then briefly about Key West. \nWe arrived to St. Augustine, Florida on January 26th, and I was so excited to finally take a shower, do laundry, and explore the city. But first we got a tour of a fort close to the marina, Castillo De Marcos. When we got back, we split into our watches and did our daily chores. After chores we were basically free to do anything. Caroline, another of the Ocean Class students, and I went to shower and do laundry. We went to explore St. Augustine after and we found this really cute Paris-themed macaroon store where we got some pre-dinner desserts. We walked around a little more and ate at Barefoot Bill’s. After dinner we went back to the macaroon store and bought gelato. We went back to the ship and hung out with some of the ocean students.\nWe left St. Augustine the next day. The departure from the dock went smoothly and we were able to be on the ocean that night. Our journey from St. Augustine to Key West was about 400 nautical miles which was originally going to take us seven days but we were making around 6-7 knots so it only took five days. We were cruising!\nEven though it was a short time underway, it was hard. Since we were going 6-7 knots it was very bumpy, splashy and windy. It was hard to walk around doing boat checks when the boat was tipping to one side (I fell and got soaked by the water running across the deck). When it wasn’t splashing it was hot during day watch. Before leaving St. Augustine, we got assigned new watches and watch officers. So mine is 12-4 which in my opinion is the hottest part of the day. Even though my watchmates and I struggled it was a great experience to overcome and persevere. (Note from the deckhands: Catherine’s watch also got to see a pod of ten dolphins glowing in the bioluminescent plankton as they played in the bow wave during one of our night watches, which was super cool!)",

For the 30th consecutive year at Proctor and the 50th year of at sea education for SEA, Proctor’s Ocean Classroom program took its charge to use the power of life at sea to teach lessons, afford students proximate learning opportunities, and create a life-changing adventure. \nEach trimester, roughly 40 Proctor students spend the term off-campus, studying one of Proctor’s five off-campus programs: Ocean Classroom, European Art Classroom, Proctor en Segovia, Proctor en Monteverde, and Mountain Classroom. The experiences students have on these programs fundamentally change their worldview, but often students return from off-campus programs and head straight home for a break, thus creating distance between their experience and their arrival on campus. For the first time, Ocean Classroom students had the opportunity to share their learning with the community immediately upon conclusion of the program with a culminating symposium in the Stone Chapel. Families, faculty, staff, and students joined together to see Ocean Classroom’s individual research projects conducted over the last eight weeks. \nSeeing the excitement that comes from persevering through a challenging experience like Ocean Classroom is contagious. Each of these students has navigated their own learning journey in life; a journey that led them to Proctor and the unique combination of support and rigor that exists in our classrooms and on our off-campus programs. Within every off-campus program roster, there is a complex mix of neuroprofiles, and yet because Proctor’s culture thrives on integrated support, self-advocacy, and self-awareness, students thrive in an academic environment as diverse as their learning profiles. For SEA educators, they saw a competent, curious group of young people who successfully navigate the academic rigors of the college level semester-at-sea courses and research. \nWitnessing students present their research this evening served as a powerful reminder of what is possible when young people are immersed in an environment that has high expectations, understands they learn differently, and believes in them. As students presented their research projects, shared about their voyage, and beamed with pride to their families, we sat in awe of what they were able to accomplish. Teenagers are capable of so much more than we think; we/schools just need to give them a chance to show us. \nOcean Classroom 2023, we are so incredibly proud of you, and we hope you are proud of yourselves. Thank you, students, for being such powerful ambassadors of Proctor in the maritime industry and for continuing on a 30 year tradition of Ocean Classroom! \nThank you also to retiring Ocean Classroom Program Director Brooks Bicknell '77 for being the true navigator of the program and for ensuring the Ocean Classroom tradition continued when we hit especially rough seas in 2018. \nLearn more about Proctor's Ocean Classroom Program HERE!",

Teenagers are capable of so much more than we think; we/schools just need to give them a chance to show us. \n\n![Proctor Academy Ocean Classroom 2023](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1699579376/proctoracademyorg/gbfqnpcm1pnkqsvsbuh7/235A7904.jpg)\n\n![Proctor Academy Ocean Classroom 2023](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1699579605/proctoracademyorg/loegbdhnkvk4hcjoxkm2/235A8292.jpg)\n\nOcean Classroom 2023, we are so incredibly proud of you, and we hope you are proud of yourselves.

  "text": "Proctor’s Ocean Classroom students are nearing the completion of their voyage from Bermuda to Newport, Rhode Island. The past two weeks at sea since leaving Lunenberg, Nova Scotia have proven harrowing as they navigated high seas, arrived in Bermuda for 24 hours before casting lines and getting back on the water in order to beat another potential hurricane. \nFollowing their docking in Newport on November 2, the group will transition back to SEA’s campus in Woods Hole, Massachusetts where they will complete their term long research projects in anticipation of their culminating symposium on Proctor’s campus on November 9 from 6:00-7:30 PM. We hope to see you there, and in the meantime, enjoy these recent Ship’s Log entries from students aboard the SSV Corwith Cramer! \nFriday, 20th October, 2023 | Secret Secchi Dish Mission\nNoon Position: 36 deg 26.1' N x 063 deg 48.7' W\nShip Heading (degrees): 195\nShip Speed (knots): 5.3 knots\nLog (nm): 1175 steering 195\nWeather / Wind / Sail Plan (from 1300 Watch Change): Light and variable winds build to BF 4 and 5 from the south later in the day. Description of location: Gulf Stream crossing into the Sargasso Sea\nToday started off like any regular day, getting woken up and coming onto deck very tired and looking out at the horizon and seeing pretty calm seas. Unlike last night, we were out of the Gulf Stream now and into calmer water. Except I didn't see much of a horizon because I was on dawn watch and it was 1:00 AM in the morning. I was in lab with Paige, Riley, and Alli and we were chilling, it had been a pretty calm watch since there were no deployments because of rough weather. After our watch ended and we mustered we all went straight to bed. I only got 2 hours of sleep though and then woke up at 9 and for some odd reason and couldn't fall back asleep. So I took a shower and went up on deck and before I talked to some people on C watch I noticed the sea color, it looked oddly purple for some reason.\nThen up until class at 14:30 everything went on as a normal day. The beginning of class was normal with reports on Navigation, Weather, and Science. But then for the main activity we were told that we were doing a special secchi disk bet but there were multiple colors on. So as watch we guessed which colors would disappear and which would stay the longest. But there was a surprise, instead of a secchi disk it was two containers, one of M&M's and the other one with Skittles. At first we did actually throw M&M's in the water and kept track of how long we saw them but after that we all just ate them and had a good time. Then after that it started raining for a little bit and we went to the main salon and there it was, fudge popsicles and jolly rancher Popsicle.\nNow at this moment I don't know if I could've been happier. So most people grabbed fudge popsicles and some grabbed Jolly Rancher popsicles and it was really good. Then since it was raining A-Watch was on deck and the rest of us were either sleeping or playing cards. Then it was just a normal day until about 17:30 or 4:30 PM. At which some of use went on deck\nbecause it was too hot below deck, and the first sight we see is massive waves crashing over the side of the ship and onto the deck. So what do you do at that moment you might ask, well some of us stayed down below and slept but most of us got our harness and went to the bow, and within minutes all of us were soaked.\nMost of us sat at the bow singing songs and chanting to What Do You Do With A Drunken Sailor. The swells were so big that it would hit the side of the ship and drench us all in salt water. Some people were smart and got there foulies on, Jackson even got his swim shorts on, but I\njust sat there in all cotton having the time of my life with everyone else. We sat out there for about 50 minutes and then went to dinner and dried off, then throughout the night the waves just got bigger and bigger. But most of us had fallen asleep, I wanted to but I was on watch for six hours again off of two hours of sleep, not a smart decision on my part but I had fun so I was fine with it.\nLiam M ‘25 \nOctober 20 | Dawn Watch \nWhen I was woken up by Sophie for dawn watch my first thought was, already? Having just fallen asleep after a lot of rolling around my bunk it was already time for Bravo Watch to take over the deck. Once Johnny had the con I was sent to helm. The waves were pounding against the bow of the boat and salt spraying back onto the lookout and I. Steering in the huge waves was difficult but eventually I got the hang of it. A boat check and learning how to use the GPS to track other boats was next. The trick to a good dawn watch is to just keep on doing things. Onto the third hour and I was assigned to forward lookout, singing to keep myself awake and alert. Liam paid a special visit from lab and we discussed our Pizza Chef orders. Every Dawn watch at about 0400 a watch comes together on the quarter deck for tea time. Today's tea time was special though. Since there was lightning nearby all of the students were sent to the lab. Waiting out the storm over M&Ms and chai we talked about our upcoming arrival to Bermuda and the first things we want to do when we arrive. Many answers included just being on solid land. \nWakeups, a few dishes, stealing the leftover apples and peanut butter from breakfast and one last boat check ended my dawn watch. Immediately I flung myself into my bed and went back to sleep after a long and salty six hours. Whenever I am on dawn watch I use the time to reflect on the trip so far. I think about the new friendships I've made and the old ones I've strengthened. I think about my family and how I can't wait to see them when I return back to land. I have come up with many ways to keep my mind awake during the hours of darkness. Although dawn watch is not my favorite watch time to be on I try to make the best of it as much as I can.\nTess ‘25 \nTuesday, October 24, 2023 | Bermuda Arrival \nLog: 1540 nm\nWeather: Spotty squalls, strong wind, warm water and ice cream.\nDescription of location: St. George's Bay, Bermuda\nAfter a challenging week of sailing through intense weather, it was so exciting when we heard Whistler say \"Land Ho\" while standing at forward lookout. As soon as the faint outline of Bermuda came into view, we mustered at the bow in awe. The dark blue, choppy water all of a sudden turned a gorgeous turquoise color, seeming clear. After tidying up the boat and\nfurling the sails, the Bermuda pilot boat began to lead us through the channel towards the dock. Motoring into the Bermuda port was unlike anything I have experienced and it was extremely different than Lunenburg. Luscious greenery and uniquely colored homes lined the shore of the narrow channel. It felt surreal.\nAs our dock arrival neared, it became hectic as we finished setting up fenders and dock lines. As I was trying my best to hang on ever so tightly to a fender over the science deck, I realized that in a matter of minutes I would get to give Elsa the biggest hug. Oh how we have missed her\nso much! A hectic hour later, Elsa and Brooks were allowed aboard the Corwith Cramer! We had so much fun sharing stories about all of our unique journeys.\nThe Bermuda Customs Office was so efficient! In what felt like a matter of minutes, we were cleared to get off the ship! After these very rocky days aboard, it felt pretty good to step on solid ground. We spent an amazing rest of our day exploring the gorgeous town of St. Georges. Our first stop was ice cream (which wasn't much of a surprise considering the insane amount of ice cream we all indulged in while in Lunenburg) and then we were off to Tobacco Bay to swim! It was a gorgeous snorkeling and swimming cove which had unique rock and sand formations lining the division from where the water rolled in from the Atlantic.\nAfter exploring different coves and taking in the view from Tobacco Bay, it was time for a dinner and oh how our group LOVES to eat! All 22 of us were able to be seated at the same restaurant on an outdoor patio overlooking the water. We ended our amazing day in Bermuda with full bellies and lots of laughter. Even though it's bittersweet to only get to experience all that St. Georges has to offer in just one afternoon, we made the most of it and created more memories that will last a lifetime. I am excited to see what the last leg of our trip brings as we head to Newport tomorrow. I am sure that by tomorrow we will already have started to discuss what ice cream flavor we want to get in Newport. Oh, except for Noah. He is very loyal to Vanilla every time!\nEmma H ‘25 \nWednesday, October 25, 2023 | Underway Again\nNoon Position: Lat: 32°10.7’N and Long: 064°52.1’W\nShip Heading: 225°\nShip Speed: 6.5 k\nLog: 1570 nm\nWeather: Today is sunny with a chance of some showers. We have a steady force 7 at our backs, and it is looking like a beautiful day to go sailing. Sail plan for afternoon watch is to stay clear of Challenger and Plantagenet Banks by sailing south. Then once we are clear of the banks at the South West corner of Bermuda we will begin to sail west to stay clear of Tammy.\nWow. Bermuda is a beautiful place. The water is so clear and the town and its architecture is so cool. But because of Hurricane Tammy and the weather window that has opened up, we have gotten underway again and are quickly running away from the storm. But to everyone’s delight, Elsa is back with us on the boat after not being able to join us since the beginning of the trip. B watch got up at 6:00 for a 6:20 breakfast to get us underway at 7:30. It was sad to leave Bermuda knowing we had had such a short time on shore and force 7 winds and big waves waiting for use outside of the protection of Bermuda harbor. But everyone understands we need to get going and are ready for the final leg of our voyage. As we made our way out of the harbor, we quickly began to feel the big waves and fast winds against the boat. Water was beginning to slash up onto the deck and we all knew what we had ahead. And of course, right as we are getting out of the harbor, the Proctor and SEA flags got stuck and Jeremy had to climb aloft to help free them. We begin sailing with the Main Staysl and the Fore Staysl up. We start making about 6.5 knots with just those sails which is crazy, and travel West around Bermuda. While we are making ground, I decide to go up on deck and read the Lord of the Rings. (Now father, if you do not know who is writing this yet you should now, but that is if Ma has not already scrolled to the bottom of the page to see if I am finally writing a blog.) The Morning watch was very chill and eventually lunch came around and it was LEFTOVERS. Solid lunch by Rachel and Seb. B watch then handed over the deck to C watch at 1300 till 1900. I then played Noah Young in a vicious game of spit which went on for about 45 minutes. The game went back and forth the whole time and Noah ended up coming out victorious. That took us all the way to class where Jeff talked to use about corals the geological history of Bermuda. And Captain gave us further information on what our JWO (Junior Watch Officer) watches will entail. After class, book club groups met and people took some naps. Because I have nigh watch, I am writing this blog in parts. So I have stated it at 17:00 and will pick up later during my watch.\nI have finally found myself a window of time. To pick up where I left off, dinner was really good, it was rice bowls with meat and a very good sauce. My watch then took over and now I am on lab with Emma and Nick but since a storm hit and the waves have picked up we are not able to do anything, so we have been helping out on deck. I was actually just at the helm for about an hour and a half and Emma was at look out right next to me. It was fun, but in these conditions when the boat is getting thrown, it can be really difficult to keep it on course. And while I was at helm we saw a Moon bow. It’s like a white rainbow at night. Now those on deck have taken over and Emma and I have a break before we have to do a surface station at 2300. Overall watch has been good so far with some rain and the boat heeling over a lot.\nWatch last night ended well. The Last two hours were very funny because I think everyone was starting to get a little delirious. After a good six hours of watch, B watch came to relieve us at 1:00. We had a short watch meeting and the next thing I knew I was passed out in my bed. After another great day.\nThis trip so far has truly been the experience of a lifetime. I am loving every moment from getting thrown across the boat because it is heeled over so far, to us walking around Lunenburg. The professional crew on this trip are all amazing and there is no other group of kids I would rather be experiencing this with. I have learned so much about myself and who I want to be and I am so excited to keep learning new things. These kinds of trips do not come around very often for many kids and we are such a fortunate group of people that this experience can be a reality in our lives. But sadly this trip is coming to a close soon. I am going to miss the Corwith Cramer and everyone on it. But I will always remember this experience forever.\nAnd to Mom, Dad, Annie, and most of all Maddy, I love and miss you all so much and can’t wait to see you. And, of course, let’s go Yankees.\nIan R ‘25 \nThursday, October, 26, 2023 | Another Beautiful Day in Heavy Weather \nPartially cloudy, Force 6-7 wind, Sailing under the staysails and the main on a starboard tack\nSargasso Sea\nIt's hard to encapsulate a day on the Cramer because everyone's day is always so different, but I will describe how my day went today and hope that will give you a good idea of what it was like living onboard for a day. My wakeup was at 06:00 for my 06:20 breakfast and 07:00 watch. I got out of bed and ate some biscuits made by the stews with some peanut butter. I went on deck at 06:50 for watch turnover. We are currently in our Junior Watch Officer phase and I was the first one.\nI controlled the rotation on deck to make sure everyone did every role and wasn't in the same place for too long. I also briefed the captain on our plan for the day and learned a lot about how running a watch works. Towards the end of my time on JWO, I called a sailing maneuver called gybing. It was intimidating at first but I got the hang of it quickly and became more confident. Lily was the next JWO after me, so I gave her an update and she took control. She did a very good job running the rotation and also walked us through a gybe. It was cool to be able to learn from not only my officers, but my classmates as well. After watch we ate some delicious rice bowls for lunch. I did some journaling and was able to talk with friends and relax for a few minutes before class. The bell rang for ship's meeting at 14:15 and we were all on deck at 14:30. We did our science, weather, and navigation reports for the day. Because I was on morning watch, I presented the navigation report with Lily.\nAfter reports and announcements, we had some study hall time for class. This was a nice time to be able to catch up on work I was behind on because of our busy schedule. After class, we had a lemon cake for Riley's 18th birthday that we called the \"Starboard Tack Cake\" because it was slanted in the oven and baked crooked. It was still delicious though. We all sang happy birthday and celebrated her milestone. Happy Birthday Riley!!! I went on deck for a while to get some fresh air and look at the waves. I was feeling good today but this is definitely the best cure for seasickness. It's truly a bonding experience to sit on the deck boxes with someone and look at the horizon. I took a nap before dinner, a vital part of life on a ship. I woke up for dinner and ate some amazing homemade mac and cheese with peas, such a great way to end the day. I helped clean up and hung out in the main salon until around 19:45. I'm staying up a little too late to be on dawn watch, but it's always so fun to have some laughs in the salon before going to sleep. Well, goodnight, I have dawn watch wakeups at 00:30 so I gotta get to sleep. P.S. Hi Mom, Dad, Callie, and Bob!!! I miss you all so much! See you soon enough. Love you! (Pet the animals for me).\nCade ‘25 \nFriday, October, 27 2023 | Stu Stu Day in the Sargasso Sea\nShip Heading: 320°psc\nShip Speed: 6.5kn\nLog: 1883nm\nWeather / Wind / Sail Plan: Partial cloudy, wind force 5 out of NNE, sailing under all 5 lower sails Description of location: Sargasso Sea\nToday was a rather irregular day aboard the Cramer for me because I was Asst. Asst. Steward, or in Cramer words, stu stu! Instead of standing watch today, I was cooking meals with our two stewards, an opportunity each student has once per voyage. I was stood down from my dawn watch (0100-0700), so I had a 0500 wake up to start on breakfast. Sleep in! This morning, I went pretty simple with oatmeal and cereal. Cereal was a hit because we had lucky charms, a rare Cramer delicacy. After breakfast was cleaned up, I read my book club book, Cod, on deck and took a nap. At 1000, I put out my mid-morning snack, plums, out on deck. Every morning around 0900-1100, we usually have our morning science station, which normally includes three deployments: a Secchi disc, a Neuston net tow, and a CTD with niskin bottles, as well as a surface station. After some more free time, Rachel and Sebastian (the stewards) and I started on lunch. For lunch we decided on tofu pad thai which had a delicious peanut sauce. After lunch I started on my afternoon snack, brownies!! We were done just in time for ships meeting/afternoon class. After our usual announcements and reports, we practiced our gybes and sail handling because we have just began our Junior Watch Officer phase of our voyage. During JWO phase, each student has 2 opportunities to take on a leadership role on deck; this includes calling all sail maneuvers and being responsible for everyone’s jobs and rotations. To help us understand the steps of gybing a little better, for class we gybed four times in a row. Each watch performed one gybe and each gybe was called by a student who had previously been a JWO. After class, we wrapped up with some brownies and I started on dinner. I made chicken and rice soup with rosemary focaccia on the side. In between dinner seatings, I went up on deck and enjoyed the sunset with friends. While my watch (C Watch) was preparing to take the deck for evening watch (1900-0100), I was again stood down because it was my steward day.\nWe have had some pretty consistent wind that had been in our favor since we left Bermuda two days ago, so we have been cruising at a steady rate for the last few days. The sea has also significantly settled, so the ride has been pretty pleasant compared to our leg from Lunenburg to Bermuda. I had a great day full of nice weather, science, sailing, and lots of cooking and I can’t believe the sea component is coming to a close. I hope these wonderful conditions last for the remainder of our voyage and I am excited for what’s left.\nLily ‘25 \nSaturday, 28 October, 2023 | Good Morning \nNoon Position: 33°02.47’N X 071°13.98’W\nShip Heading (degrees): 302°\nShip Speed: 4 knots\nLog: 1963 nm\nWeather / Wind / Sail Plan (from 1300 Watch Change): Warm weather and sailing until we no longer could and we had to motor. With force 4 winds coming from NEXN Description of location: Middle of the Atlantic\nThis morning Ian woke me up for breakfast at 6 am telling me that it was hot, that breakfast was in a little less than 20 minutes and that watch was in 50 minutes. I thanked him and then got dressed. After that I got out of my bunk just in time for breakfast. It was breakfast sandwiches, so good, I ate one with plenty of hot sauce and avocado and headed back to my bunk to finish getting ready. After I put on my harness I headed to the quarter deck to muster for turnover. We’re doing JWOs right now or Junior Watch Officer where two students (one for each half of watch) would have the deck and would give commands to the other students; they would mandate rotations and call out sail handling. I didn’t have to worry about it because I had already been JWO twice. On deck the A watch JWO did the turnover where they gave a debrief to the oncoming JWO (Teo) and spun the skirt on to them and gave the hat over. I actually was supposed to be on lab but I switched with Mattie because she hadn’t done morning science station often and then I switched with Noah on dish because he gets really sea sick in the galley. \nAfter turnover I headed down below to do the breakfast dishes I was in there for about two hours before Teo called me up to do some sail handling because we had to Gybe for science. After that Teo sent Liam to do dish to give me a break and Noah and I worked to the Navigation report for class that afternoon. We drew our track line stating in Woods Hole and ending at our present location. Than we got the log of all of the nautical miles we had traveled in the past 24 hours and the rhumb run, which is the nautical miles from directly where we started to where we were with no turns as the crow flies. Noah and I took a quick break for morning snack (grapefruit) and to check in on science (I didn’t win the secchi disc bet). Than Obie (our watch officer) gave us some reading to do so I read about how to steer with no compasses and only by the wind and swells and gave Noah the highlights to write on the whiteboard. After that I was put on helm for an hour before I went back to dish to start on the lunch dishes from the first seating. I had almost finished the dishes before I had to go back on deck for turnover. Paige was now JWO so she gave the debrief to C watch and they did the turnover spin. After that all of B watch met on the high side for a quick recap of watch and then we all went below deck for lunch. And that’s what a morning watch looks like for me.\nRiley ‘25 \nCheck out more photos from Ocean Classroom 2023!",

Then after that it started raining for a little bit and we went to the main salon and there it was, fudge popsicles and jolly rancher Popsicle.\n\nNow at this moment I don't know if I could've been happier. So most people grabbed fudge popsicles and some grabbed Jolly Rancher popsicles and it was really good. Then since it was raining A-Watch was on deck and the rest of us were either sleeping or playing cards. Then it was just a normal day until about 17:30 or 4:30 PM. At which some of use went on deck  \nbecause it was too hot below deck, and the first sight we see is massive waves crashing over the side of the ship and onto the deck. So what do you do at that moment you might ask, well some of us stayed down below and slept but most of us got our harness and went to the bow, and within minutes all of us were soaked.\n\nMost of us sat at the bow singing songs and chanting to What Do You Do With A Drunken Sailor. The swells were so big that it would hit the side of the ship and drench us all in salt water. Some people were smart and got there foulies on, Jackson even got his swim shorts on, but I  \njust sat there in all cotton having the time of my life with everyone else. We sat out there for about 50 minutes and then went to dinner and dried off, then throughout the night the waves just got bigger and bigger. But most of us had fallen asleep, I wanted to but I was on watch for six hours again off of two hours of sleep, not a smart decision on my part but I had fun so I was fine with it.\n\nLiam M ‘25 \n\n![Proctor Academy Ocean Classroom 2023](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1698805142/proctoracademyorg/taufclc66ojrthkacwj5/Oct-21-1small.jpg)\n\n## October 20 | Dawn Watch \n\nWhen I was woken up by Sophie for dawn watch my first thought was, already? Having just fallen asleep after a lot of rolling around my bunk it was already time for Bravo Watch to take over the deck. Once Johnny had the con I was sent to helm. The waves were pounding against the bow of the boat and salt spraying back onto the lookout and I. Steering in the huge waves was difficult but eventually I got the hang of it. A boat check and learning how to use the GPS to track other boats was next. The trick to a good dawn watch is to just keep on doing things. Onto the third hour and I was assigned to forward lookout, singing to keep myself awake and alert. Liam paid a special visit from lab and we discussed our Pizza Chef orders. Every Dawn watch at about 0400 a watch comes together on the quarter deck for tea time. Today's tea time was special though. Since there was lightning nearby all of the students were sent to the lab. Waiting out the storm over M&Ms and chai we talked about our upcoming arrival to Bermuda and the first things we want to do when we arrive. Many answers included just being on solid land. \n\nWakeups, a few dishes, stealing the leftover apples and peanut butter from breakfast and one last boat check ended my dawn watch. Immediately I flung myself into my bed and went back to sleep after a long and salty six hours. Whenever I am on dawn watch I use the time to reflect on the trip so far. I think about the new friendships I've made and the old ones I've strengthened. I think about my family and how I can't wait to see them when I return back to land. I have come up with many ways to keep my mind awake during the hours of darkness. Although dawn watch is not my favorite watch time to be on I try to make the best of it as much as I can.\n\nTess ‘25 \n\n![Proctor Academy Ocean Classroom 2023](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1698805158/proctoracademyorg/jvk3j7iuhvox3vf7dccg/Oct-24-Img-1small.jpg)\n\n## Tuesday, October 24, 2023 | Bermuda Arrival \n\nLog: 1540 nm  \nWeather: Spotty squalls, strong wind, warm water and ice cream.  \nDescription of location: St. George's Bay, Bermuda\n\nAfter a challenging week of sailing through intense weather, it was so exciting when we heard Whistler say \"Land Ho\" while standing at forward lookout. As soon as the faint outline of Bermuda came into view, we mustered at the bow in awe. The dark blue, choppy water all of a sudden turned a gorgeous turquoise color, seeming clear. After tidying up the boat and  \nfurling the sails, the Bermuda pilot boat began to lead us through the channel towards the dock. Motoring into the Bermuda port was unlike anything I have experienced and it was extremely different than Lunenburg. Luscious greenery and uniquely colored homes lined the shore of the narrow channel. It felt surreal.\n\nAs our dock arrival neared, it became hectic as we finished setting up fenders and dock lines. As I was trying my best to hang on ever so tightly to a fender over the science deck, I realized that in a matter of minutes I would get to give Elsa the biggest hug. Oh how we have missed her  \nso much! A hectic hour later, Elsa and Brooks were allowed aboard the Corwith Cramer! We had so much fun sharing stories about all of our unique journeys.\n\nThe Bermuda Customs Office was so efficient! In what felt like a matter of minutes, we were cleared to get off the ship! After these very rocky days aboard, it felt pretty good to step on solid ground. We spent an amazing rest of our day exploring the gorgeous town of St. Georges. Our first stop was ice cream (which wasn't much of a surprise considering the insane amount of ice cream we all indulged in while in Lunenburg) and then we were off to Tobacco Bay to swim! It was a gorgeous snorkeling and swimming cove which had unique rock and sand formations lining the division from where the water rolled in from the Atlantic.\n\nAfter exploring different coves and taking in the view from Tobacco Bay, it was time for a dinner and oh how our group LOVES to eat! All 22 of us were able to be seated at the same restaurant on an outdoor patio overlooking the water. We ended our amazing day in Bermuda with full bellies and lots of laughter. Even though it's bittersweet to only get to experience all that St. Georges has to offer in just one afternoon, we made the most of it and created more memories that will last a lifetime. I am excited to see what the last leg of our trip brings as we head to Newport tomorrow. I am sure that by tomorrow we will already have started to discuss what ice cream flavor we want to get in Newport. Oh, except for Noah. He is very loyal to Vanilla every time!\n\nEmma H ‘25 \n\n![Proctor Academy Ocean Classroom 2023](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1698805174/proctoracademyorg/tn6v7eob6vlwhonwwrxz/Oct-24-Img-3small.jpg)\n\n## Wednesday, October 25, 2023 | Underway Again\n\nNoon Position: Lat: 32°10.7’N and Long: 064°52.1’W  \nShip Heading: 225°  \nShip Speed: 6.5 k  \nLog: 1570 nm  \nWeather: Today is sunny with a chance of some showers. We have a steady force 7 at our backs, and it is looking like a beautiful day to go sailing. Sail plan for afternoon watch is to stay clear of Challenger and Plantagenet Banks by sailing south. Then once we are clear of the banks at the South West corner of Bermuda we will begin to sail west to stay clear of Tammy.\n\nWow. Bermuda is a beautiful place. The water is so clear and the town and its architecture is so cool. But because of Hurricane Tammy and the weather window that has opened up, we have gotten underway again and are quickly running away from the storm. But to everyone’s delight, Elsa is back with us on the boat after not being able to join us since the beginning of the trip. B watch got up at 6:00 for a 6:20 breakfast to get us underway at 7:30. It was sad to leave Bermuda knowing we had had such a short time on shore and force 7 winds and big waves waiting for use outside of the protection of Bermuda harbor. But everyone understands we need to get going and are ready for the final leg of our voyage. As we made our way out of the harbor, we quickly began to feel the big waves and fast winds against the boat. Water was beginning to slash up onto the deck and we all knew what we had ahead. And of course, right as we are getting out of the harbor, the Proctor and SEA flags got stuck and Jeremy had to climb aloft to help free them. We begin sailing with the Main Staysl and the Fore Staysl up. We start making about 6.5 knots with just those sails which is crazy, and travel West around Bermuda. While we are making ground, I decide to go up on deck and read the Lord of the Rings. (Now father, if you do not know who is writing this yet you should now, but that is if Ma has not already scrolled to the bottom of the page to see if I am finally writing a blog.) The Morning watch was very chill and eventually lunch came around and it was LEFTOVERS. Solid lunch by Rachel and Seb. B watch then handed over the deck to C watch at 1300 till 1900. I then played Noah Young in a vicious game of spit which went on for about 45 minutes. The game went back and forth the whole time and Noah ended up coming out victorious. That took us all the way to class where Jeff talked to use about corals the geological history of Bermuda. And Captain gave us further information on what our JWO (Junior Watch Officer) watches will entail. After class, book club groups met and people took some naps. Because I have nigh watch, I am writing this blog in parts. So I have stated it at 17:00 and will pick up later during my watch.\n\nI have finally found myself a window of time. To pick up where I left off, dinner was really good, it was rice bowls with meat and a very good sauce. My watch then took over and now I am on lab with Emma and Nick but since a storm hit and the waves have picked up we are not able to do anything, so we have been helping out on deck. I was actually just at the helm for about an hour and a half and Emma was at look out right next to me. It was fun, but in these conditions when the boat is getting thrown, it can be really difficult to keep it on course. And while I was at helm we saw a Moon bow. It’s like a white rainbow at night. Now those on deck have taken over and Emma and I have a break before we have to do a surface station at 2300. Overall watch has been good so far with some rain and the boat heeling over a lot.\n\nWatch last night ended well. The Last two hours were very funny because I think everyone was starting to get a little delirious. After a good six hours of watch, B watch came to relieve us at 1:00. We had a short watch meeting and the next thing I knew I was passed out in my bed. After another great day.\n\nThis trip so far has truly been the experience of a lifetime. I am loving every moment from getting thrown across the boat because it is heeled over so far, to us walking around Lunenburg. The professional crew on this trip are all amazing and there is no other group of kids I would rather be experiencing this with. I have learned so much about myself and who I want to be and I am so excited to keep learning new things. These kinds of trips do not come around very often for many kids and we are such a fortunate group of people that this experience can be a reality in our lives.  But sadly this trip is coming to a close soon. I am going to miss the Corwith Cramer and everyone on it. But I will always remember this experience forever.\n\nAnd to Mom, Dad, Annie, and most of all Maddy, I love and miss you all so much and can’t wait to see you. And, of course, let’s go Yankees.\n\nIan R ‘25 \n\n## Thursday, October, 26, 2023 | Another Beautiful Day in Heavy Weather \n\nPartially cloudy, Force 6-7 wind, Sailing under the staysails and the main on a starboard tack  \nSargasso Sea\n\nIt's hard to encapsulate a day on the Cramer because everyone's day is always so different, but I will describe how my day went today and hope that will give you a good idea of what it was like living onboard for a day. My wakeup was at 06:00 for my 06:20 breakfast and 07:00 watch. I got out of bed and ate some biscuits made by the stews with some peanut butter. I went on deck at 06:50 for watch turnover. We are currently in our Junior Watch Officer phase and I was the first one.\n\nI controlled the rotation on deck to make sure everyone did every role and wasn't in the same place for too long. I also briefed the captain on our plan for the day and learned a lot about how running a watch works. Towards the end of my time on JWO, I called a sailing maneuver called gybing. It was intimidating at first but I got the hang of it quickly and became more confident. Lily was the next JWO after me, so I gave her an update and she took control. She did a very good job running the rotation and also walked us through a gybe. It was cool to be able to learn from not only my officers, but my classmates as well. After watch we ate some delicious rice bowls for lunch. I did some journaling and was able to talk with friends and relax for a few minutes before class. The bell rang for ship's meeting at 14:15 and we were all on deck at 14:30. We did our science, weather, and navigation reports for the day. Because I was on morning watch, I presented the navigation report with Lily.\n\nAfter reports and announcements, we had some study hall time for class. This was a nice time to be able to catch up on work I was behind on because of our busy schedule. After class, we had a lemon cake for Riley's 18th birthday that we called the \"Starboard Tack Cake\" because it was slanted in the oven and baked crooked.  It was still delicious though. We all sang happy birthday and celebrated her milestone. Happy Birthday Riley!!! I went on deck for a while to get some fresh air and look at the waves. I was feeling good today but this is definitely the best cure for seasickness. It's truly a bonding experience to sit on the deck boxes with someone and look at the horizon. I took a nap before dinner, a vital part of life on a ship. I woke up for dinner and ate some amazing homemade mac and cheese with peas, such a great way to end the day. I helped clean up and hung out in the main salon until around 19:45. I'm staying up a little too late to be on dawn watch, but it's always so fun to have some laughs in the salon before going to sleep. Well, goodnight, I have dawn watch wakeups at 00:30 so I gotta get to sleep. P.S. Hi Mom, Dad, Callie, and Bob!!! I miss you all so much! See you soon enough. Love you! (Pet the animals for me).\n\nCade ‘25 \n\n## Friday, October, 27 2023 | Stu Stu Day in the Sargasso Sea\n\nShip Heading: 320°psc  \nShip Speed: 6.5kn  \nLog: 1883nm  \nWeather / Wind / Sail Plan: Partial cloudy, wind force 5 out of NNE, sailing under all 5 lower sails Description of location: Sargasso Sea\n\nToday was a rather irregular day aboard the Cramer for me because I was Asst. Asst. Steward, or in Cramer words, stu stu! Instead of standing watch today, I was cooking meals with our two stewards, an opportunity each student has once per voyage. I was stood down from my dawn watch (0100-0700), so I had a 0500 wake up to start on breakfast. Sleep in! This morning, I went pretty simple with oatmeal and cereal. Cereal was a hit because we had lucky charms, a rare Cramer delicacy. After breakfast was cleaned up, I read my book club book, Cod, on deck and took a nap. At 1000, I put out my mid-morning snack, plums, out on deck. Every morning around 0900-1100, we usually have our morning science station, which normally includes three deployments: a Secchi disc, a Neuston net tow, and a CTD with niskin bottles, as well as a surface station. After some more free time, Rachel and Sebastian (the stewards) and I started on lunch. For lunch we decided on tofu pad thai which had a delicious peanut sauce. After lunch I started on my afternoon snack, brownies!! We were done just in time for ships meeting/afternoon class. After our usual announcements and reports, we practiced our gybes and sail handling because we have just began our Junior Watch Officer phase of our voyage. During JWO phase, each student has 2 opportunities to take on a leadership role on deck; this includes calling all sail maneuvers and being responsible for everyone’s jobs and rotations. To help us understand the steps of gybing a little better, for class we gybed four times in a row. Each watch performed one gybe and each gybe was called by a student who had previously been a JWO. After class, we wrapped up with some brownies and I started on dinner. I made chicken and rice soup with rosemary focaccia on the side. In between dinner seatings, I went up on deck and enjoyed the sunset with friends. While my watch (C Watch) was preparing to take the deck for evening watch (1900-0100), I was again stood down because it was my steward day.\n\nWe have had some pretty consistent wind that had been in our favor since we left Bermuda two days ago, so we have been cruising at a steady rate for the last few days. The sea has also significantly settled, so the ride has been pretty pleasant compared to our leg from Lunenburg to Bermuda. I had a great day full of nice weather, science, sailing, and lots of cooking and I can’t believe the sea component is coming to a close. I hope these wonderful conditions last for the remainder of our voyage and I am excited for what’s left.\n\nLily ‘25 \n\n## Saturday, 28 October, 2023 | Good Morning \n\nNoon Position: 33°02.47’N  X  071°13.98’W  \nShip Heading (degrees): 302°  \nShip Speed: 4 knots  \nLog: 1963 nm  \nWeather / Wind / Sail Plan (from 1300 Watch Change): Warm weather and sailing until we no longer could and we had to motor. With force 4 winds coming from NEXN Description of location: Middle of the Atlantic\n\nThis morning Ian woke me up for breakfast at 6 am telling me that it was hot, that breakfast was in a little less than 20 minutes and that watch was in 50 minutes. I thanked him and then got dressed. After that I got out of my bunk just in time for breakfast. It was breakfast sandwiches, so good, I ate one with plenty of hot sauce and avocado and headed back to my bunk to finish getting ready. After I put on my harness I headed to the quarter deck to muster for turnover. We’re doing JWOs right now or Junior Watch Officer where two students (one for each half of watch) would have the deck and would give commands to the other students; they would mandate rotations and call out sail handling. I didn’t have to worry about it because I had already been JWO twice. On deck the A watch JWO did the turnover where they gave a debrief to the oncoming JWO (Teo) and spun the skirt on to them and gave the hat over. I actually was supposed to be on lab but I switched with Mattie because she hadn’t done morning science station often and then I switched with Noah on dish because he gets really sea sick in the galley. \n\nAfter turnover I headed down below to do the breakfast dishes I was in there for about two hours before Teo called me up to do some sail handling because we had to Gybe for science. After that Teo sent Liam to do dish to give me a break and Noah and I worked to the Navigation report for class that afternoon. We drew our track line stating in Woods Hole and ending at our present location. Than we got the log of all of the nautical miles we had traveled in the past 24 hours and the rhumb run, which is the nautical miles from directly where we started to where we were with no turns as the crow flies. Noah and I took a quick break for morning snack (grapefruit) and to check in on science (I didn’t win the secchi disc bet). Than Obie (our watch officer) gave us some reading to do so I read about how to steer with no compasses and only by the wind and swells and gave Noah the highlights to write on the whiteboard. After that I was put on helm for an hour before I went back to dish to start on the lunch dishes from the first seating. I had almost finished the dishes before I had to go back on deck for turnover. Paige was now JWO so she gave the debrief to C watch and they did the turnover spin. After that all of B watch met on the high side for a quick recap of watch and then we all went below deck for lunch. And that’s what a morning watch looks like for me.\n\nRiley ‘25  \n\n## [Check out more photos from Ocean Classroom 2023!](https://www.flickr.com/photos/proctoracademy/albums/72177720311054613)"

  "text": "Proctor's 30th year of Ocean Classroom adventures continues as the student crew aboard the SSV Corwith Cramer arrived in Lunenberg, Nova Scotia and continued their marine studies in the harbor town. The past week saw Ocean Classroom navigate from Gloucester, Massachusetts across the Gulf of Maine to Nova Scotia. Read all about it below. \nMonday, October 9th 2023 | An Alumni Perspective \nNoon Position: (Lat and Long): 42°46.905’N X 068°54.749’W\nShip Heading (degrees): 110°\nLog (nm): 370.2\nWeather / Wind / Sail Plan (from 1300 Watch Change): BF 4, SW wind with\nmain, main stay’sl, fore stay’sl, jib set\nDescription of location: (e.g. 10 nm SE of Georges Bank): Gulf of Maine,\nsouthern area of Cashses Ledge\nA little introduction for this narrative. Chief Scientist Jeff Schell requested a crew log entry, so I volunteered. My name is Kara Baird and I am a Program Assistant for Ocean Classroom. I have been living with the students on campus since their program started and have shifted into a deckhand role on board the Cramer. I graduated from Proctor Academy in 2020 and was an Ocean Classroom student aboard Roseway in 2019. I have been sailing tall ships since my Ocean Classroom and am so excited to facilitate the same environment for the students that I once had.\nToday was a hefty day for C Watch, but they stood up to the challenge! We had dawn watch (0100-0700) and night watch (1900-0100). The students have been practicing their skills in lab with a nighttime meter net deployment and many hundred counts. Their skills in navigation are advancing as they are plotting dead reckoning and accounting for set and drift on a paper chart. I don’t spend much time in lab as I am deckhand, but I am so impressed with the work I have been able to see. The students’ knowledge has expanded from struggling to draw copepods in the on shore lab, to being able to spot them in seconds in Cramer’s lab. Throughout the watches, students were given challenges and always rose up to the task at hand. We struck and furled the main’sl and jib in less than 30 minutes. Again, so amazed by their quick progression!\nOne thing I valued on my Ocean Classroom was the ability to be present. We must always be observing how the environment around us impacts our sails, the vessel, and our own person. We also have time to be less focused off watch and are able to enjoy time on deck with our shipmates. Because we are in an environment built on thoughtful actions and little distraction from the outside world, we are able to strengthen our community and ourselves. Students are playing cards, reading books, learning instruments, taking notes in their Sheet Anchors. They are constantly growing and asking to absorb more. It is truly a pleasure to be a part of the unique community that Ocean Classroom builds and see how SEA’s focus on science strengthens it.\nBest,\nKara Baird ‘20\nProgram Assistant, C Watch\nTuesday, 10 October 2023 | A Day in the Life of a Sailor \nNoon Position: 41°01.482’N 66°48.830’W\nHeading: 092°\nSpeed: 4 kts\nLog: 476.7 nm\nWeather: Mostly clear skies, scattered altocumulus. 20°C. Seas 3-4 ft. Beaufort\nForce 2-3.\nSail Plan: Continue eastward to waypoint south of Nova Scotia.\nDescription of location: Gulf of Maine, northwest of Brown’s Bank.\nSqualor 00:30\nPumped for dawn watch (0100-0700), I jump out of my bunk. A-watch’s previous times for dawn watch had been while we were at anchor and I had only stood watch for shorter increments (while anchored in Nantucket and Gloucester). The Corwith Cramer needs less hands while she is not actively sailing, but there still needs to be anchor checks, boat checks, engine checks, science hourlies and an active presence on deck at all times. While at anchor, watches split up into three small groups that stand for only two hours, ensuring that six hours are split evenly. This morning is no anchor watch, seeing as we’re in the middle of the Gulf of Maine, and my excitement gets me out of bed faster than my usual response time at this hour. Walking by\nthe ladder to use the head, the near-frigid air reminds me to layer smartly for the upcoming watch.\nSaloon 00:40\nAfter digging around in the foulie locker for a solid five minutes, I don my layers, foul weather gear (bib, jacket and boots) and make my way to the aft ladder. Peeking at the watch schedule on my way by, I am reminded that I am on lab duty for the upcoming watch.\nCharthouse 00:45\nClimbing up the aft ladder into the charthouse, I look over the charts and our plotted positions from recent hours. Looking over the various names of the underwater features in our area, I gain a broad sense of where we are in the sea. While the surface of the ocean is oftentimes mind-numbingly featureless, structures on the seafloor are diverse and plentiful in the Gulf of Maine.\nQuarterdeck 00:48\nI step onto the deck and am greeted with the sound of waves breaking around us. The conditions are a five on the Beaufort Force Scale, excellent sailing weather. The seas do not seem to have calmed down a considerable amount from post-tropical cyclone Philippe.\nLab 00:50\nMadi, Whistler and I step into the lab, ready to be briefed by C-Watch and directed by our science officer, Ali.\nDeck 01:20\nWhile many sail adjustments are manageable with the members of the watch assigned to the deck, larger sails, like the foretopsail, require a few more hands. The watch rallies to pull the sail out from its stowed position, furled against the mast. Eventually the sail is set and the Cramer is now sailing on a reach with her foretopsail, forestaysail, mainstay sail and jib.\nLab 01:30\nGetting right back to work, the lab team starts processing the various seaweed and critters captured by a net tow the previous day. Madi and I start with separating out euphausids that are larger than about two centimeters while Whistler records observations regarding bioluminescence, salinity, temperature and many more.\nDeck 03:30\nThe wind has diminished to around a Force 2. Chief Mate Johnny gives the order to start the main engine and strike the foretopsail. Whistler, Madi and I step out of the lab to assist.\nLab 03:45\nGrateful for the chance to keep my blood moving and energy up, I finish separating the contents of the net tow and set up to identify the various plankton we collected.\nLab 04:30\nAli and Madi conduct a surface station. They collect a bucket of water from the surface of the water and separate it into various containers to test for nutrients and chlorophyll-a. Whistler and I remain inside the lab to conduct a ‘one-hundred count’ of the net tow. This process involves separating one-hundred separate organisms at random from those captured in the net tow. Under the current conditions, I struggle to use a pointed tool to move organisms of small sizes across the petri dish under the microscope for Whistler to identify and tally.\nBow 05:30\nDOLPHINS! Several dolphins are darting around the bow and are kicking up bioluminescence, reminiscent of neon blue fireworks.\nDeck 06:15\nFinished with the majority of our processing, I rinse out our buckets on deck. The sunrise is gorgeous. There are multiple squalls on the horizon and the light reflected off of them is orange-pinkish. The seas have calmed since the beginning of dawn watch and the sunrise is quite peaceful. A rainbow has formed against one of the closer squalls, bringing a plethora of visual variety to this morning seascape. This is a perfect way to wrap up the last hour of our long dawn watch.\nLab 06:45\nAfter finishing clean-up, Ali, Madi, Whistler and I compile a list of to-dos for the next watch and recap the work we did in the lab logbook as those on B-Watch emerge from below decks.\nDeck 06:50\nI’m very much looking forward to crawling in my bunk, but the work isn’t quite done yet. It’s time to set the mainsail. Both A-Watch and B-Watch are needed to set the largest sail on the boat. After expending the rest of my strength with my crewmates hauling the halyard, I am ready to go to bed, but I am hungrier than I am tired.\nSaloon 07:10\nOur stewards, Rachael and Sebastian, never come up short when it comes to a meal. Today, they are assisted by Emma, the day’s student steward. The pancakes, both chocolate chip and plain, absolutely hit the spot after six hours of work. I am headed straight to bed after I clear my plate.\nSqualor 10:30\nI heard snack was apples, so I put on my boots and emerged to grab a few slices. Now I’m awake, it’s time to get to work.\nLibrary 11:30\nAfter reading a considerable amount of Death Ship and writing a journal response to the section, I move on to compiling which data collections are viable for my group’s research project. Riley, Ryan and I are researching how meroplankton are affected by temperature at the depth of highest biomass density. We chose this depth to give us the best chance of finding large amounts of data for the project. Various nets are towed most everyday behind the Cramer, but not all the tows target the depth of highest biomass density. To determine this depth, we can use the Acoustic Current Doppler Profiler, which can tell my group where the depth of highest biomass density was and when. Then, we can mark which tows are eligible for our project and copy the data collected onto our own data sheets to analyze.\nSaloon 13:00\nLunch is tuna salad sandwiches and kale salad. Like always, it is absolutely delicious.\nQuarterdeck 13:25\nStanding on the quarterdeck, I take in the beautiful day. Teo, on the helm, spots a whale blow off the starboard side. Well spotted, there are two more before the whales leave.\nBow 13:40\nMORE DOLPHINS! Three fairly large dolphins are darting to and fro across the bow and through the bow wake. It’s incredible to see them this close to the ship. I suppose without the sound of the main engine, they aren’t as annoyed.\nDeck 14:15\nFire drill! There are multiple callouts of a ‘fire’ in the galley and the general alarm rings out. We quickly muster at our watch stations to ensure all are on deck and disperse to carry out our responsibilities. Assigned to fire hose two, I roll out the hose on the port side and point the nozzle over the side, waiting for the pumps to turn on. After the pumps are activated, the captain orders the hoses to be sprayed on the course sail so that the water will cascade onto the deck above the galley. Boundary cooling is the job of the students while other measures are taken to ensure the fire doesn’t spread, such as closing the water tight doors, closing off ventilation hatches and more.\nQuarterdeck 14:40\nAfter the drill is over, the ship’s company musters on the quarterdeck to discuss the drill and how to improve our response to a fire. Ship’s meeting is usually at 14:30, so we roll right into it. Captain Coughlin gives a presentation about fire about how we can optimize our response to it. Cole and Ian report on the expected weather for the near future. Madi, Whistler\nand I recap our findings in the net tow. Finally, Teo leads the navigation report, detailing the ship’s positions over the last day. After some discussion about the plan for our upcoming port stop in Lunenburg, ship’s meeting ends and we all disperse.\nLibrary 18:00\nDinner for A-Watch is in twenty minutes and I am looking forward to ending the day how I started it. A-Watch is on for evening watch (1900-0100) and when I first heard about how the schedule has one watch on for two six hour periods a day, I was taken aback. However, it makes more sense to not think about days. You are on watch for six hours, then off for twelve. So a day is more of an eighteen hour period. Three watches, A-Watch, B-Watch, and C-Watch, rotate through four watch periods, dawn watch (0100-0700), morning watch (0700-1300), afternoon watch (1300-1900) and evening watch (1900-0100).\nWhile a day in the life of a student aboard the Corwith Cramer may sound hectic and tiring, learning to navigate the open ocean, understand the life and environment around you and adapting to living in close-quarters is rewarding to no end. On that note, here’s the rest of my day.\n18:20, Dinner.\n19:00, On- watch.\n01:00, Off-watch.\n01:20, Good night.\n- Cass D.

Beam reach, starboard tack 4 lowers\n(jib, fore and main stays’l, and mains’l)\nDescription of location: About 50 nm south of Lunenburg, Nova Scotia\nStarting off - HAPPY BIRTHDAY MRS. STIRRATT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ocean is epic and so far it has gone like this: there are four watches every day—morning watch, afternoon watch, evening watch and dawn watch. Each is 6 hours long and afterwards a watch has 12 hours off until their next 6 hours on. Breakfast for ongoing watch is at 6:20, breakfast for offgoing watch and lazy watch is at 7. When we’re not on watch, we’re free to sleep, chill, and wander the boat as we please. A lot of us read and journal on the Elephant table, which is the roof of the ship’s lab. We can also lie out on the head rig, the net at the very front of the boat. This is the best when it’s sunny out. On watch, we are split into three different areas: on deck, the lab, or helping in the galley. There are always 3 people on deck, 2-3 in the lab, and 1 person doing dishes. On the day a watch has dawn watch, one person from them is assigned to be the steward for the day and cook with our lovely Raechel and Sebastian. Tomorrow, for example, C-Watch has dawn watch and our very own Isabel will be steward for the day instead of joining us on deck at 1am. On deck, we rotate between being the helmsman and lookout, or performing hourly boat checks and weather reports. In the lab we help with deployments or processing deployments and all that jazz.\nThis morning I was woken up by Tessica Gatti from Bravo watch at 6:00A.M, since my watch was on morning watch from 7A.M. to 1P.M. I fell asleep the night before at around 8:30PM reading 1984 which I found in the aforementioned library. Mom you were wrong I have already finished all my books!!!!!!!!!!!!! Except for Little Fires Everywhere – it just didn’t resonate with me. But it’s okay because in the library they have It Ends With Us which I know you love and I plan to read after Emma finishes. Anyways you’d think that with nearly 10 hours of sleep I’d be ready to attack the day, but I was very sleepy. Luckily Riley was the steward today and clutched up with the banana bread and yogurt combo for breakfast. After munching up I went back to my bunk to layer up, got my red smartwools underneath my work pants, my white long sleeve with my wool UGA sweater on overtop, and my pink beanie.\nToday I was in the lab with my favorite scientist, Jordan Eckstein, our crew’s 1st scientist, along with Tally Ho Stirrat and Jackson Ganache. We had a busy day in lab today – we deployed a Shipek Grab, Secchi Dish, CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth profiler), a Neuston Net and a surface station. One has to wonder, why are we doing all this science when we’re here to sail? Honestly, I really don’t know. We need data for our oceanography projects. The other day though, on evening watch, the wind was WHIPPIN’ and we were not sailing so that move at the slow pace necessary for science deployments. But, I argued, we could be whippin’ right now if we just set a few sails! But we must know the amount of meroplankton instead of getting to Nova Scotia earlier. Pick your battles I guess.\nThe deployments were a lot of fun and being with Tallulah and Jackson allowed for a lot of laughs. We also set and struck down a bunch of sails so we were active. Morning watch is probably my favorite because it’s during the day, so I can literally see, but also once it’s done we still have the rest of the day. I say that even though after watch today I ate lunch, read\nsome of my book and then sacked out until Jordan woke me up for dinner. Lol! Tomorrow I have dawn watch. Dawn watch is brutal. Here’s hoping that this time there will be the lovely sunrise I’ve been waiting for. I am HYPE for tomorrow – we arrive in Nova Scotia, we can do our laundry, we can call home, and we get to meander on land and see what’s up with Canadians. Also I can see my favorite maritime studies teacher, Ben Caw Hen, our maritime studies teacher. On Friday we are to spend the entire day ashore with Ben maritime studying, and Saturday we depart Lunenburg and head for Bermuda. Ocean is an intricate mix of challenging and fun. We have so many good things on the horizon and I’m soakin’ up every minute of it. Get ready for those phone calls y’all. Rem, Dad, Blajo and Debbie – be on your phones! Also Proctor people check your mailboxes. I wrote to you. \nAll my love,\nRyan J.

Bright and early this morning, I was woken up for my 6:20 breakfast of oatmeal and bacon, fueling me for my final 7:00 watch before our very first port stop. Every morning when I make my way on deck I take in a gorgeous ocean view, only today I was surrounded by Canadian evergreens, the first trees we’ve seen in a minute! We mustered on\nthe quarterdeck as we sailors do, and Captain gave us orders to begin preparations to haul back anchor. Our C-watchers sailed the Cramer into Nova Scotia in the wee hours of last night and anchored, so we only had a quick trip to find our space to dock. As the sun came up we maneuvered our way out of the inlet and towards our destination. Normally, students try to sleep in when it’s not their turn for morning watch but we’ve been crazy excited to finally get a look at what this little fishing town could be, so everyone came up on deck.\nSailing in, Lunenburg seemed somewhat smaller than what I expected. The night before Madi and Noah had been asking if there would be a Chipotle nearby. Boy, were we wrong. Not a burrito in sight. Lunenburg turned out to be the cutest little fishing town I’ve ever seen with its scattered multi-colored houses and lobster pot Christmas trees. For most of today all we could do is observe from afar as were we still considered a foreign vessel and needed to get checked in by customs. I spent the nine hours waiting to get cleared furling the sails, playing spit with Emma, laying in the hammock with Lula, eating lucky charms, gossiping with Cole and Cade, singing with Madi, and waiting some more! Finally, just when we were about to give up hope our fearless leader gave us the good news. We also were given our phones to make calls home for the first time in six weeks. I got to talk to my mom and dad, which only made me miss them more as well as all my friends back home. The minute we stepped off the boat we made a run for the ice cream shop and hurried as we only were left with 45 minutes until we had to be back on the boat. We walked down the street and started screaming at the sight of our favorite Maritime Studies teacher, BEN! We missed him so much! Ben is here to take us on a tour of Lunenburg and give us a lesson on its history tomorrow during our full day at port. Now it’s 20:00, I’m about to head up on deck again, lay on the top of the lab and look at the stars with my friends. I can’t wait for tomorrow and to get to see much more of Lunenburg before we set sail again to continue our voyage.\nLove you all and please write to us!\nWhistler ‘25 \nFriday, 13 October, 2023 | Welcome to Lunenberg \nNoon Position: 44 22.5N 064 18.6W\nLog (nm): 658.1\nWeather: raining\nDescription of location: Lunenburg (a sick little town)\nToday we went to a museum! (The Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic). It was a little dreary outside but we had fun and it fit the vibe of the small fishing town of Lunenburg. We learned about fishing history, scallops and some crusty musty old wooden boats but they were cool. We also deep dived into the cod industry and how people lived while at sea. After the museum, we decided to do some laundry and we took way too long and it made me reflect on how I wanted maple syrup cuz we in Canada! While we waited on our clothes I got a pint of cookie dough ice cream to munch on that I shared with Madi. When laundry was finally done we took a stroll back to town to drop off our laundry.\nThen we decided to go get some food when we stumbled upon the fish shack where only the day before I got a big plate of fish and chips, where it was devoured in seconds. But since it was the hottest place around, we decided to get a delicious last taste of America with a nice fat juicy bacon cheeseburger which was gone in exactly 0.345367 seconds. Then it hit me that I absolutely NEEDED a dose of maple syrup cuz we in Canada! I scoured the streets only to turn up empty handed which still breaks my heart and will be for the rest of my life. Otherwise, it was a fantastic day in the midst of Nova Scotia, Canada!\nTeo ‘25 \nSaturday, October 14, 2023 | A Day About Town\nNoon Position: 44°22.5’N 064° 18.6’W\nLog (nm): 658.1\nWeather / Wind / Sail Plan: Sunny/cloudy, some rain clouds, making it a\nlittle chilly.\nDescription of location: Lunenburg, a really cute and small town. Looks like\na little European town. It’s a really cool town, and I highly recommend it.\nToday was a really cool day. We got to experience this really cool thing called field day. When you hear the word field day, you might think about playing capture the flag or any field games, but not on a ship. Field day is where everyone comes together to clean the entire boat. Not just a simple clean, I mean getting down and dirty in every little crease. You might think that will take you all day and will not be much fun, but it was a lot of fun.\nI am on A-watch, which was in charge of cleaning the galley. We had music playing so loud and were jamming out. It took no time. We also did fire lines, where we make this huge line of people and pass everything from the galley up onto deck, for people to go through and clean. A watch did a really good job of getting everything cleaned and having a concert at the same time. After we were done cleaning, we had lunch. Then, we had a meeting on the quarter deck (the aft most part of the deck). Everyone got together and talked about the weather, class, announcements, etc. Today we got to hear from Captain Coughlin, Jeff (our chief scientist) and Johnny (the first mate). Johnny started us off with how great we did in cleaning the boat and how we did a great job. Then, we heard from Captain saying that she had some news about the weather and our departure from Nova Scotia. The weather reports show that we could be in waves over 30ft and winds over 50 knots. She decided that we should stay, let the storm pass on by and hope to sneak out Monday morning. We were all happy and sad. We were happy because we love Nova Scotia and we get to spend more time here but we are also sad because we want to go to Bermuda.\nAfter the meeting, we got to go into town all day today and it was so much fun. We all stated our day off with going to the thrift store and trying clothes on. Then, we all went to go get the first ice cream of the day. Then, we went to so many more stores until we could drop with exhaustion. Finally, we decided where we all wanted to go for dinner and we split up to go to different restaurants. My group had really good pizzas and salads and the other group got seafood. After we all finished dinner, we met up again in town and got the second ice cream of the day. After ice cream, we came back to the boat for the night. Now that we are in Lunenburg for a few more days, you will get to hear from a few other people and what they think of Lunenburg.\nSophie H ‘25 \nSunday, 15 October 2023 | A Ten Star Review Day\nNoon Position: 44°22.5’N 64° 18.6’W\nLog: 658.1nm\nWeather: Chilly Nova Scotian breeze with some sunshine!\nDescription of location: Lunenburg, Nova Scotia\nWhat a day! After our unexpected delayed departure from Lunenburg, the crew pulled together quite the extravaganza. Groups of three are woken up at different times of the night due to dock watch. Madi and I had the pleasure of experiencing sleep deprivation with Scientist Jordan! At 0500, we went on deck with some warm tea and got to work drawing everyone on board,\ncreatively waiting for our boat check. At 0700, wake-ups were conducted by Madi and I. We stumbled around telling people to wake up while barely able to keep our eyes open ourselves. After a lovely breakfast provided by our amazing stewards, we split into our respective watches to go on a field trip and delve into productivity. While A-Watch went out on the town, the other two watches met with our watch officers and had a good study hall. After that, my watch was lucky enough to visit Lunenburg’s shops again. It was a successful visit that included a shiny ring and some presents for home. Following this exciting venture was a Nautical Science class where we gained more experience with sail handling. More specifically, we practiced rigging both shallow and deep reefs in the mainsail simultaneously. Then, it was time for the long awaited B-Watch field trip! We toured Lunenburg with the most fantastic storyteller, Nancy. She runs Seaweed Tours and drove us to different areas of Lunenburg, recounting countless seafaring stories from solemn tales of lost ships to her times working at her father’s fisherman’s pub. She took us to Lunenburg academy (the town school), old churches, graveyards, a scallop dock, and a small bay. She was so amazing and provided us with memories that will last for quite a while. My overalls, which are the most amazing to ever exist of planet earth, made the experience so much better. They were borrowed from the revolving closet we have amongst the\ngals. They are so comfortable and I felt like a fishing farmer. Following this was one final dinner in Lunenburg. A few of us went to a small restaurant where drinks were spilled, chaos ensued and laughs were endless.\nAt long last, we bid goodbye to Lunenburg, kissed the docks farewell and climbed back aboard our home, the Corwith Cramer. Now we are back on the boat, experiencing stinky feet, a few exploding sinks, attempts to air out bunks, loads of card games, late nights where a touch of insanity takes hold of all of us, bonker days and buckets upon buckets of laughter. Life has never been more challenging and joyful! Lunenburg was so good to us and these unexpected extra days were truly a gift and will be treasured by all of us.\nMiss you all and wishing the best!\nPaige ‘25 \nMonday, 16 October 2023\nNoon Position: 44°04.3’N 064° 09.0’W\nShip Heading: 195°\nShip Speed: 6 knots\nLog: 679.8nm\nWeather: Cold and cloudy with some NNW winds\nDescription of location: 20nm S of Lunenburg\nEarly this morning we departed Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, after an amazing 4 days there. B-Watch was on watch that morning so we were responsible for leaving dock. The students were on fender control, which controls the bumper buoys so the ship doesn’t hit the dock. We had rotated watch officers this past weekend, so today was our first real watch with them. Our watches stayed the same but we switched mates, scientists, and deckhands. We first had the 2nd mate Jeremy, 2nd scientist Nick, and our deckhand Maggie. Now, we rotated to the chief mate Johnny, 3rd scientist Ali, and Hillary as our deckhand.\nIt was tricky getting out of the dock in Lunenburg. Teo was on helm (steering the ship) while the rest of us were either sail handling or stowing various items. After we got underway this morning, I was in lab with Teo and Tess. We did a few deployments, including the secci disk (records light penetration in the water column), a shipek grab (collects seafloor sediment), and a neuston net tow. We caught a starfish in our shipek grab which was crazy very cool. In the neuston tow, we caught a juvenile cod which was also interesting. Ian was the winner for our secci disk bets with 9m (which is the 18% light penetration depth). While all of this was happening we noticed two land birds from Lunenburg on the boat, we named them Rick and Morty.\nAfter we turned the watch over to C-Watch we all ate lunch and I took a nice nap. Then we had class at 1430 which included our normal science, navigation, and weather reports. But then it started raining so we had to move inside to the main salon. Today’s class was about different ocean zones at different depths and wildlife’s adaptation to those different environments. After that I took another nice nap until dinner. Overall today was a pretty good day with a lot going on.\n- Noah '25 \nTraining on Timberwind \nBecause of my visa issue, I cannot sail on Cramer with everyone up to Nova Scotia, and I have to meet everyone in Bermuda. However, Brooks figured out an excellent alternative plan for me sailing on a schooner with a crew up in Portland, Maine. To be honest, I was very nervous about the unexplored situation that would happen on the schooner. It turns out that everyone on the boat is friendly and patient; they are always willing to let me participate when we are sailing, even if I mess up a few times. I also gained so much new knowledge about the ship, wind, and of course, sailing. By the end of the week, I started to know what I should do when the captain ordered something when I should start hauling, coiling, and even sometimes telling the captain what was happening in the ocean. It was a fun and educational experience, but the coolest part about working on Timberwind is not even sailing. I get to communicate with people from all over the world since Timerwind is a tourist schooner. I get to talk with all those incredible people who share or not share the same experience with me. It was an enjoyable experience, but the inner of my heart still wanted to get on Cramer. Sometimes, when I mess up things, the awareness of making mistakes in front of everyone takes over the joyfulness of sailing. And I wish someone was struggling like me so I would feel better, even though this feeling is super selfish. While overall, my experience in Portland, besides sailing, was also excellent. Brooks and I went to a lovely coffee shop every morning and went to Trader Joe's for some groceries; we even went to Freeport to shop and got delicious sushi afterward. It was an excellent way to prepare for the ship even though I still needed to wait one more week. :( At the very end, I miss everyone on the boat, and please tell them I miss them. \nElsa ‘24 \nCheck out more photos from Ocean Classroom 2023!",
  "markdown": "Proctor's 30th year of Ocean Classroom adventures continues as the student crew aboard the SSV Corwith Cramer arrived in Lunenberg, Nova Scotia and continued their marine studies in the harbor town. The past week saw Ocean Classroom navigate from Gloucester, Massachusetts across the Gulf of Maine to Nova Scotia. Read all about it below. \n\n![Proctor Academy Ocean Classroom](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1697680985/proctoracademyorg/mser5k2pvkiixzlyv40m/20231008_212333920_iOS.jpg)\n\n## Monday, October 9th 2023 | An Alumni Perspective \n\nNoon Position: (Lat and Long): 42°46.905’N X 068°54.749’W  \nShip Heading (degrees): 110°  \nLog (nm): 370.2  \nWeather / Wind / Sail Plan (from 1300 Watch Change): BF 4, SW wind with  \nmain, main stay’sl, fore stay’sl, jib set  \nDescription of location: (e.g. 10 nm SE of Georges Bank): Gulf of Maine,  \nsouthern area of Cashses Ledge\n\nA little introduction for this narrative. Chief Scientist Jeff Schell requested a crew log entry, so I volunteered. My name is Kara Baird and I am a Program Assistant for Ocean Classroom. I have been living with the students on campus since their program started and have shifted into a deckhand role on board the Cramer. I graduated from Proctor Academy in 2020 and was an Ocean Classroom student aboard Roseway in 2019. I have been sailing tall ships since my Ocean Classroom and am so excited to facilitate the same environment for the students that I once had.\n\nToday was a hefty day for C Watch, but they stood up to the challenge! We had dawn watch (0100-0700) and night watch (1900-0100). The students have been practicing their skills in lab with a nighttime meter net deployment and many hundred counts. Their skills in navigation are advancing as they are plotting dead reckoning and accounting for set and drift on a paper chart. I don’t spend much time in lab as I am deckhand, but I am so impressed with the work I have been able to see. The students’ knowledge has expanded from struggling to draw copepods in the on shore lab, to being able to spot them in seconds in Cramer’s lab. Throughout the watches, students were given challenges and always rose up to the task at hand. We struck and furled the main’sl and jib in less than 30 minutes. Again, so amazed by their quick progression!\n\nOne thing I valued on my Ocean Classroom was the ability to be present. We must always be observing how the environment around us impacts our sails, the vessel, and our own person. We also have time to be less focused off watch and are able to enjoy time on deck with our shipmates. Because we are in an environment built on thoughtful actions and little distraction from the outside world, we are able to strengthen our community and ourselves. Students are playing cards, reading books, learning instruments, taking notes in their Sheet Anchors. They are constantly growing and asking to absorb more. It is truly a pleasure to be a part of the unique community that Ocean Classroom builds and see how SEA’s focus on science strengthens it.\n\nBest,  \nKara Baird ‘20  \nProgram Assistant, C Watch\n\n![Proctor Academy Ocean Classroom](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1697681016/proctoracademyorg/gjo6crpfw3lw6ahtnivq/20231006_141528690_iOS.jpg)\n\n## Tuesday, 10 October 2023 | A Day in the Life of a Sailor \n\nNoon Position: 41°01.482’N 66°48.830’W  \nHeading: 092°  \nSpeed: 4 kts  \nLog: 476.7 nm  \nWeather: Mostly clear skies, scattered altocumulus. 20°C.

A-watch’s previous times for dawn watch had been while we were at anchor and I had only stood watch for shorter increments (while anchored in Nantucket and Gloucester). The Corwith Cramer needs less hands while she is not actively sailing, but there still needs to be anchor checks, boat checks, engine checks, science hourlies and an active presence on deck at all times. While at anchor, watches split up into three small groups that stand for only two hours, ensuring that six hours are split evenly. This morning is no anchor watch, seeing as we’re in the middle of the Gulf of Maine, and my excitement gets me out of bed faster than my usual response time at this hour. Walking by  \nthe ladder to use the head, the near-frigid air reminds me to layer smartly for the upcoming watch.\n\nSaloon 00:40  \nAfter digging around in the foulie locker for a solid five minutes, I don my layers, foul weather gear (bib, jacket and boots) and make my way to the aft ladder. Peeking at the watch schedule on my way by, I am reminded that I am on lab duty for the upcoming watch.\n\nCharthouse 00:45  \nClimbing up the aft ladder into the charthouse, I look over the charts and our plotted positions from recent hours. Looking over the various names of the underwater features in our area, I gain a broad sense of where we are in the sea. While the surface of the ocean is oftentimes mind-numbingly featureless, structures on the seafloor are diverse and plentiful in the Gulf of Maine.\n\nQuarterdeck 00:48  \nI step onto the deck and am greeted with the sound of waves breaking around us. The conditions are a five on the Beaufort Force Scale, excellent sailing weather. The seas do not seem to have calmed down a considerable amount from post-tropical cyclone Philippe.\n\nLab 00:50  \nMadi, Whistler and I step into the lab, ready to be briefed by C-Watch and directed by our science officer, Ali.\n\nDeck 01:20  \nWhile many sail adjustments are manageable with the members of the watch assigned to the deck, larger sails, like the foretopsail, require a few more hands. The watch rallies to pull the sail out from its stowed position, furled against the mast. Eventually the sail is set and the Cramer is now sailing on a reach with her foretopsail, forestaysail, mainstay sail and jib.\n\nLab 01:30  \nGetting right back to work, the lab team starts processing the various seaweed and critters captured by a net tow the previous day. Madi and I start with separating out euphausids that are larger than about two centimeters while Whistler records observations regarding bioluminescence, salinity, temperature and many more.\n\nDeck 03:30  \nThe wind has diminished to around a Force 2. Chief Mate Johnny gives the order to start the main engine and strike the foretopsail. Whistler, Madi and I step out of the lab to assist.\n\nLab 03:45  \nGrateful for the chance to keep my blood moving and energy up, I finish separating the contents of the net tow and set up to identify the various plankton we collected.\n\nLab 04:30  \nAli and Madi conduct a surface station. They collect a bucket of water from the surface of the water and separate it into various containers to test for nutrients and chlorophyll-a. Whistler and I remain inside the lab to conduct a ‘one-hundred count’ of the net tow. This process involves separating one-hundred separate organisms at random from those captured in the net tow. Under the current conditions, I struggle to use a pointed tool to move organisms of small sizes across the petri dish under the microscope for Whistler to identify and tally.\n\nBow 05:30  \nDOLPHINS! Several dolphins are darting around the bow and are kicking up bioluminescence, reminiscent of neon blue fireworks.\n\nDeck 06:15  \nFinished with the majority of our processing, I rinse out our buckets on deck. The sunrise is gorgeous. There are multiple squalls on the horizon and the light reflected off of them is orange-pinkish. The seas have calmed since the beginning of dawn watch and the sunrise is quite peaceful. A rainbow has formed against one of the closer squalls, bringing a plethora of visual variety to this morning seascape. This is a perfect way to wrap up the last hour of our long dawn watch.\n\nLab 06:45  \nAfter finishing clean-up, Ali, Madi, Whistler and I compile a list of to-dos for the next watch and recap the work we did in the lab logbook as those on B-Watch emerge from below decks.\n\nDeck 06:50  \nI’m very much looking forward to crawling in my bunk, but the work isn’t quite done yet. It’s time to set the mainsail. Both A-Watch and B-Watch are needed to set the largest sail on the boat. After expending the rest of my strength with my crewmates hauling the halyard, I am ready to go to bed, but I am hungrier than I am tired.\n\nSaloon 07:10  \nOur stewards, Rachael and Sebastian, never come up short when it comes to a meal. Today, they are assisted by Emma, the day’s student steward. The pancakes, both chocolate chip and plain, absolutely hit the spot after six hours of work. I am headed straight to bed after I clear my plate.\n\nSqualor 10:30  \nI heard snack was apples, so I put on my boots and emerged to grab a few slices. Now I’m awake, it’s time to get to work.\n\nLibrary 11:30  \nAfter reading a considerable amount of Death Ship and writing a journal response to the section, I move on to compiling which data collections are viable for my group’s research project. Riley, Ryan and I are researching how meroplankton are affected by temperature at the depth of highest biomass density. We chose this depth to give us the best chance of finding large amounts of data for the project. Various nets are towed most everyday behind the Cramer, but not all the tows target the depth of highest biomass density. To determine this depth, we can use the Acoustic Current Doppler Profiler, which can tell my group where the depth of highest biomass density was and when. Then, we can mark which tows are eligible for our project and copy the data collected onto our own data sheets to analyze.\n\nSaloon 13:00  \nLunch is tuna salad sandwiches and kale salad. Like always, it is absolutely delicious.\n\nQuarterdeck 13:25  \nStanding on the quarterdeck, I take in the beautiful day. Teo, on the helm, spots a whale blow off the starboard side. Well spotted, there are two more before the whales leave.\n\nBow 13:40  \nMORE DOLPHINS! Three fairly large dolphins are darting to and fro across the bow and through the bow wake. It’s incredible to see them this close to the ship. I suppose without the sound of the main engine, they aren’t as annoyed.\n\nDeck 14:15  \nFire drill! There are multiple callouts of a ‘fire’ in the galley and the general alarm rings out. We quickly muster at our watch stations to ensure all are on deck and disperse to carry out our responsibilities. Assigned to fire hose two, I roll out the hose on the port side and point the nozzle over the side, waiting for the pumps to turn on. After the pumps are activated, the captain orders the hoses to be sprayed on the course sail so that the water will cascade onto the deck above the galley. Boundary cooling is the job of the students while other measures are taken to ensure the fire doesn’t spread, such as closing the water tight doors, closing off ventilation hatches and more.\n\nQuarterdeck 14:40  \nAfter the drill is over, the ship’s company musters on the quarterdeck to discuss the drill and how to improve our response to a fire. Ship’s meeting is usually at 14:30, so we roll right into it. Captain Coughlin gives a presentation about fire about how we can optimize our response to it. Cole and Ian report on the expected weather for the near future. Madi, Whistler  \nand I recap our findings in the net tow. Finally, Teo leads the navigation report, detailing the ship’s positions over the last day. After some discussion about the plan for our upcoming port stop in Lunenburg, ship’s meeting ends and we all disperse.\n\nLibrary 18:00  \nDinner for A-Watch is in twenty minutes and I am looking forward to ending the day how I started it. A-Watch is on for evening watch (1900-0100) and when I first heard about how the schedule has one watch on for two six hour periods a day, I was taken aback. However, it makes more sense to not think about days. You are on watch for six hours, then off for twelve. So a day is more of an eighteen hour period. Three watches, A-Watch, B-Watch, and C-Watch, rotate through four watch periods, dawn watch (0100-0700), morning watch (0700-1300), afternoon watch (1300-1900) and evening watch (1900-0100).\n\nWhile a day in the life of a student aboard the Corwith Cramer may sound hectic and tiring, learning to navigate the open ocean, understand the life and environment around you and adapting to living in close-quarters is rewarding to no end. On that note, here’s the rest of my day.\n\n18:20, Dinner.  \n19:00, On- watch.  \n01:00, Off-watch.  \n01:20, Good night.\n\n\\- Cass D. '24 \n\n## Wednesday, 11 October 2023 | Day 9 at Sea \n\nNoon Position: (Lat and Long):  43° 30.3’N 064° 51.8’W  \nShip Heading (degrees): 080 degrees  \nShip Speed (knots): slow  \nLog (nm): 583nm  \nWeather / Wind / Sail Plan (from 1300 Watch Change):  winds light and  \nvariable, sometimes from the south.  Beam reach, starboard tack 4 lowers  \n(jib, fore and main stays’l, and mains’l)  \nDescription of location:  About 50 nm south of Lunenburg, Nova Scotia\n\nStarting off - HAPPY BIRTHDAY MRS. STIRRATT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ocean is epic and so far it has gone like this: there are four watches every day—morning watch, afternoon watch, evening watch and dawn watch. Each is 6 hours long and afterwards a watch has 12 hours off until their next 6 hours on. Breakfast for ongoing watch is at 6:20, breakfast for offgoing watch and lazy watch is at 7. When we’re not on watch, we’re free to sleep, chill, and wander the boat as we please. A lot of us read and journal on the Elephant table, which is the roof of the ship’s lab. We can also lie out on the head rig, the net at the very front of the boat.  This is the best when it’s sunny out. On watch, we are split into three different areas: on deck, the lab, or helping in the galley. There are always 3 people on deck, 2-3 in the lab, and 1 person doing dishes. On the day a watch has dawn watch, one person from them is assigned to be the steward for the day and cook with our lovely Raechel and Sebastian. Tomorrow, for example, C-Watch has dawn watch and our very own Isabel will be steward for the day instead of joining us on deck at 1am. On deck, we rotate between being the helmsman and lookout, or performing hourly boat checks and weather reports. In the lab we help with deployments or processing deployments and all that jazz.\n\nThis morning I was woken up by Tessica Gatti from Bravo watch at 6:00A.M, since my watch was on morning watch from 7A.M. to 1P.M. I fell asleep the night before at around 8:30PM reading 1984 which I found in the aforementioned library. Mom you were wrong I have already finished all my books!!!!!!!!!!!!! Except for Little Fires Everywhere – it just didn’t resonate with me. But it’s okay because in the library they have It Ends With Us which I know you love and I plan to read after Emma finishes. Anyways you’d think that with nearly 10 hours of sleep I’d be ready to attack the day, but I was very sleepy. Luckily Riley was the steward today and clutched up with the banana bread and yogurt combo for breakfast. After munching up I went back to my bunk to layer up, got my red smartwools underneath my work pants, my white long sleeve with my wool UGA sweater on overtop, and my pink beanie.\n\nToday I was in the lab with my favorite scientist, Jordan Eckstein, our crew’s 1st scientist, along with Tally Ho Stirrat and Jackson Ganache. We had a busy day in lab today – we deployed a Shipek Grab, Secchi Dish, CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth profiler), a Neuston Net and a surface station. One has to wonder, why are we doing all this science when we’re here to sail? Honestly, I really don’t know. We need data for our oceanography projects. The other day though, on evening watch, the wind was WHIPPIN’ and we were not sailing so that move at the slow pace necessary for science deployments. But, I argued, we could be whippin’ right now if we just set a few sails! But we must know the amount of meroplankton instead of getting to Nova Scotia earlier. Pick your battles I guess.\n\nThe deployments were a lot of fun and being with Tallulah and Jackson allowed for a lot of laughs. We also set and struck down a bunch of sails so we were active. Morning watch is probably my favorite because it’s during the day, so I can literally see, but also once it’s done we still have the rest of the day. I say that even though after watch today I ate lunch, read  \nsome of my book and then sacked out until Jordan woke me up for dinner. Lol! Tomorrow I have dawn watch. Dawn watch is brutal. Here’s hoping that this time there will be the lovely sunrise I’ve been waiting for. I am HYPE for tomorrow – we arrive in Nova Scotia, we can do our laundry, we can call home, and we get to meander on land and see what’s up with Canadians. Also I can see my favorite maritime studies teacher, Ben Caw Hen, our maritime studies teacher. On Friday we are to spend the entire day ashore with Ben maritime studying, and Saturday we depart Lunenburg and head for Bermuda. Ocean is an intricate mix of challenging and fun. We have so many good things on the horizon and I’m soakin’ up every minute of it. Get ready for those phone calls y’all. Rem, Dad, Blajo and Debbie – be on your phones! Also Proctor people check your mailboxes. I wrote to you.  \n\nAll my love,  \nRyan J. '24, Crab watch or “cwatch”\n\n## Thursday, October 12, 2023 | Arrival in Nova Scotia\n\nNoon Position: (Lat and Long):  44° 22.5’N 064° 18.6’W  \nLog (nm):  658.1nm  \nWeather / Wind / Sail Plan (from 1300 Watch Change):  Clear, sunny skies,  \nmoderate temps.  \nDescription of location: Docked in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia\n\nOur first day in Lunenburg! Bright and early this morning, I was woken up for my 6:20 breakfast of oatmeal and bacon, fueling me for my final 7:00 watch before our very first port stop. Every morning when I make my way on deck I take in a gorgeous ocean view, only today I was surrounded by Canadian evergreens, the first trees we’ve seen in a minute! We mustered on  \nthe quarterdeck as we sailors do, and Captain gave us orders to begin preparations to haul back anchor. Our C-watchers sailed the Cramer into Nova Scotia in the wee hours of last night and anchored, so we only had a quick trip to find our space to dock. As the sun came up we maneuvered our way out of the inlet and towards our destination. Normally, students try to sleep in when it’s not their turn for morning watch but we’ve been crazy excited to finally get a look at what this little fishing town could be, so everyone came up on deck.\n\nSailing in, Lunenburg seemed somewhat smaller than what I expected. The night before Madi and Noah had been asking if there would be a Chipotle nearby. Boy, were we wrong. Not a burrito in sight. Lunenburg turned out to be the cutest little fishing town I’ve ever seen with its scattered multi-colored houses and lobster pot Christmas trees. For most of today all we could do is observe from afar as were we still considered a foreign vessel and needed to get checked in by customs. I spent the nine hours waiting to get cleared furling the sails, playing spit with Emma, laying in the hammock with Lula, eating lucky charms, gossiping with Cole and Cade, singing with Madi, and waiting some more! Finally, just when we were about to give up hope our fearless leader gave us the good news. We also were given our phones to make calls home for the first time in six weeks. I got to talk to my mom and dad, which only made me miss them more as well as all my friends back home. The minute we stepped off the boat we made a run for the ice cream shop and hurried as we only were left with 45 minutes until we had to be back on the boat. We walked down the street and started screaming at the sight of our favorite Maritime Studies teacher, BEN! We missed him so much! Ben is here to take us on a tour of Lunenburg and give us a lesson on its history tomorrow during our full day at port. Now it’s 20:00, I’m about to head up on deck again, lay on the top of the lab and look at the stars with my friends. I can’t wait for tomorrow and to get to see much more of Lunenburg before we set sail again to continue our voyage.\n\nLove you all and please write to us!\n\nWhistler ‘25 \n\n## Friday, 13 October, 2023 | Welcome to Lunenberg \n\nNoon Position: 44 22.5N 064 18.6W  \nLog (nm): 658.1  \nWeather: raining  \nDescription of location: Lunenburg (a sick little town)\n\nToday we went to a museum! (The Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic).  It was a little dreary outside but we had fun and it fit the vibe of the small fishing town of Lunenburg. We learned about fishing history, scallops and some crusty musty old wooden boats but they were cool. We also deep dived into the cod industry and how people lived while at sea. After the museum, we decided to do some laundry and we took way too long and it made me reflect on how I wanted maple syrup cuz we in Canada! While we waited on our clothes I got a pint of cookie dough ice cream to munch on that I shared with Madi. When laundry was finally done we took a stroll back to town to drop off our laundry.\n\nThen we decided to go get some food when we stumbled upon the fish shack where only the day before I got a big plate of fish and chips, where it  was devoured in seconds. But since it was the hottest place around, we decided to get a delicious last taste of America with a nice fat juicy bacon cheeseburger which was gone in exactly 0.345367 seconds. Then it hit me that I absolutely NEEDED a dose of maple syrup cuz we in Canada! I scoured the streets only to turn up empty handed which still breaks my heart and will be for the rest of my life.  Otherwise, it was a fantastic day in the midst of Nova Scotia, Canada!\n\nTeo ‘25 \n\n## Saturday, October 14, 2023 | A Day About Town\n\nNoon Position: 44°22.5’N 064° 18.6’W  \nLog (nm): 658.1  \nWeather / Wind / Sail Plan: Sunny/cloudy, some rain clouds, making it a  \nlittle chilly.  \nDescription of location: Lunenburg, a really cute and small town. Looks like  \na little European town. It’s a really cool town, and I highly recommend it.\n\nToday was a really cool day. We got to experience this really cool thing called field day. When you hear the word field day, you might think about playing capture the flag or any field games, but not on a ship. Field day is where everyone comes together to clean the entire boat. Not just a simple clean, I mean getting down and dirty in every little crease. You might think that will take you all day and will not be much fun, but it was a lot of fun.\n\nI am on A-watch, which was in charge of cleaning the galley. We had music playing so loud and were jamming out. It took no time. We also did fire lines, where we make this huge line of people and pass everything from the galley up onto deck, for people to go through and clean. A watch did a really good job of getting everything cleaned and having a concert at the same time. After we were done cleaning, we had lunch. Then, we had a meeting on the quarter deck (the aft most part of the deck). Everyone got together and talked about the weather, class, announcements, etc. Today we got to hear from Captain Coughlin, Jeff (our chief scientist) and Johnny (the first mate). Johnny started us off with how great we did in cleaning the boat and how we did a great job. Then, we heard from Captain saying that she had some news about the weather and our departure from Nova Scotia. The weather reports show that we could be in waves over 30ft and winds over 50 knots. She decided that we should stay, let the storm pass on by and hope to sneak out Monday morning. We were all happy and sad. We were happy because we love Nova Scotia and we get to spend more time here but we are also sad because we want to go to Bermuda.\n\nAfter the meeting, we got to go into town all day today and it was so much fun. We all stated our day off with going to the thrift store and trying clothes on. Then, we all went to go get the first ice cream of the day. Then, we went to so many more stores until we could drop with exhaustion. Finally, we decided where we all wanted to go for dinner and we split up to go to different restaurants. My group had really good pizzas and salads and the other group got seafood. After we all finished dinner, we met up again in town and got the second ice cream of the day. After ice cream, we came back to the boat for the night. Now that we are in Lunenburg for a few more days, you will get to hear from a few other people and what they think of Lunenburg.\n\nSophie H ‘25 \n\n## Sunday, 15 October 2023 | A Ten Star Review Day\n\nNoon Position: 44°22.5’N 64° 18.6’W  \nLog: 658.1nm  \nWeather: Chilly Nova Scotian breeze with some sunshine!  \nDescription of location: Lunenburg, Nova Scotia\n\nWhat a day! After our unexpected delayed departure from Lunenburg, the crew pulled together quite the extravaganza. Groups of three are woken up at different times of the night due to dock watch. Madi and I had the pleasure of experiencing sleep deprivation with Scientist Jordan! At 0500, we went on deck with some warm tea and got to work drawing everyone on board,  \ncreatively waiting for our boat check. At 0700, wake-ups were conducted by Madi and I. We stumbled around telling people to wake up while barely able to keep our eyes open ourselves. After a lovely breakfast provided by our amazing stewards, we split into our respective watches to go on a field trip and delve into productivity. While A-Watch went out on the town, the other two watches met with our watch officers and had a good study hall. After that, my watch was lucky enough to visit Lunenburg’s shops again. It was a successful visit that included a shiny ring and some presents for home. Following this exciting venture was a Nautical Science class where we gained more experience with sail handling. More specifically, we practiced rigging both shallow and deep reefs in the mainsail simultaneously. Then, it was time for the long awaited B-Watch field trip! We toured Lunenburg with the most fantastic storyteller, Nancy. She runs Seaweed Tours and drove us to different areas of Lunenburg, recounting countless seafaring stories from solemn tales of lost ships to her times working at her father’s fisherman’s pub. She took us to Lunenburg academy (the town school), old churches, graveyards, a scallop dock, and a small bay. She was so amazing and provided us with memories that will last for quite a while. My overalls, which are the most amazing to ever exist of planet earth, made the experience so much better. They were borrowed from the revolving closet we have amongst the  \ngals. They are so comfortable and I felt like a fishing farmer. Following this was one final dinner in Lunenburg. A few of us went to a small restaurant where drinks were spilled, chaos ensued and laughs were endless.\n\nAt long last, we bid goodbye to Lunenburg, kissed the docks farewell and climbed back aboard our home, the Corwith Cramer. Now we are back on the boat, experiencing stinky feet, a few exploding sinks, attempts to air out bunks, loads of card games, late nights where a touch of insanity takes hold of all of us, bonker days and buckets upon buckets of laughter. Life has never been more challenging and joyful! Lunenburg was so good to us and these unexpected extra days were truly a gift and will be treasured by all of us.\n\nMiss you all and wishing the best!\n\nPaige ‘25 \n\n## Monday, 16 October 2023\n\nNoon Position: 44°04.3’N 064° 09.0’W  \nShip Heading: 195°  \nShip Speed: 6 knots  \nLog: 679.8nm  \nWeather: Cold and cloudy with some NNW winds  \nDescription of location: 20nm S of Lunenburg\n\nEarly this morning we departed Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, after an amazing 4 days there. B-Watch was on watch that morning so we were responsible for leaving dock. The students were on fender control, which controls the bumper buoys so the ship doesn’t hit the dock. We had rotated watch officers this past weekend, so today was our first real watch with them. Our watches stayed the same but we switched mates, scientists, and deckhands. We first had the 2nd mate Jeremy, 2nd scientist Nick, and our deckhand Maggie. Now, we rotated to the chief mate Johnny, 3rd scientist Ali, and Hillary as our deckhand.\n\nIt was tricky getting out of the dock in Lunenburg. Teo was on helm (steering the ship) while the rest of us were either sail handling or stowing various items. After we got underway this morning, I was in lab with Teo and Tess. We did a few deployments, including the secci disk (records light penetration in the water column), a shipek grab (collects seafloor sediment), and a neuston net tow. We caught a starfish in our shipek grab which was crazy very cool. In the neuston tow, we caught a juvenile cod which was also interesting. Ian was the winner for our secci disk bets with 9m (which is the 18% light penetration depth). While all of this was happening we noticed two land birds from Lunenburg on the boat, we named them Rick and Morty.\n\nAfter we turned the watch over to C-Watch we all ate lunch and I took a nice nap. Then we had class at 1430 which included our normal science, navigation, and weather reports. But then it started raining so we had to move inside to the main salon. Today’s class was about different ocean zones at different depths and wildlife’s adaptation to those different environments. After that I took another nice nap until dinner. Overall today was a pretty good day with a lot going on.\n\n\\- Noah '25 \n\n## Training on Timberwind \n\nBecause of my visa issue, I cannot sail on Cramer with everyone up to Nova Scotia, and I have to meet everyone in Bermuda. However, Brooks figured out an excellent alternative plan for me sailing on a schooner  with a crew up in Portland, Maine. To be honest, I was very nervous about the unexplored situation that would happen on the schooner. It turns out that everyone on the boat is friendly and patient; they are always willing to let me participate when we are sailing, even if I mess up a few times. I also gained so much new knowledge about the ship, wind, and of course, sailing. By the end of the week, I started to know what I should do when the captain ordered something when I should start hauling, coiling, and even sometimes telling the captain what was happening in the ocean. It was a fun and educational experience, but the coolest part about working on Timberwind is not even sailing. I get to communicate with people from all over the world since Timerwind is a tourist schooner. I get to talk with all those incredible people who share or not share the same experience with me. It was an enjoyable experience, but the inner of my heart still wanted to get on Cramer. Sometimes, when I mess up things, the awareness of making mistakes in front of everyone takes over the joyfulness of sailing. And I wish someone was struggling like me so I would feel better, even though this feeling is super selfish. While overall, my experience in Portland, besides sailing, was also excellent. Brooks and I went to a lovely coffee shop every morning and went to Trader Joe's for some groceries; we even went to Freeport to shop and got delicious sushi afterward. It was an excellent way to prepare for the ship even though I still needed to wait one more week. :( At the very end, I miss everyone on the boat, and please tell them I miss them. \n\nElsa ‘24 \n\n## [Check out more photos from Ocean Classroom 2023!](https://www.flickr.com/photos/proctoracademy/albums/72177720311054613)"

  "text": "Proctor Academy’s 30th year of Ocean Classroom voyages set sail aboard the SSC Corwith Cramer on Monday, October 2023 after a three week shore component of the program. As the ship navigates to Nova Scotia, educators and students share daily logs from sea via the Sea Education Association website. We have compiled the first week of Ship’s Logs below so you can read about life at sea!\nMonday, 02 October 2023\nNoon Position: (Lat and Long): 41 deg 31.4’ N x 070 deg 40.3’W\nShip Heading (degrees): NA\nShip Speed (knots): NA\nLog (nm): 0.0\nWeather / Wind / Sail Plan (from 1300 Watch Change): Sunny, dry and cool.\nDescription of Location: Alongside Dyers Dock in Woods Hole, MA\nWelcome to the SSV Corwith Cramer! The students and crew have now merged as one shipboard community. We are now a complement of 21 student-crew and 15 professional crew – a full ship’s complement – our crew for the upcoming voyage. The students have been given their Watch assignments (Alpha, Bravo and Charlie Watch, or A, B, and C) and at present are getting to know their Mate and Scientist who will introduce them to life aboard the ship. This evening we will remain comfortably alongside the dock in Woods Hole, MA, allowing us to dive right into the all-important safety training required for new crew members.\nLife aboard an SEA ship is always an adventure. Full of learning opportunities and responsibilities. Before we depart Woods Hole, each student must learn how to properly wear their safety harness, which allows them to safely deploy scientific equipment and climb into the head rig to furl sails. Students need to learn about the infamous Boat Check – an hourly walk through of all compartments on the ship to ensure all is well. Students need to learn how to make detailed weather observations, and how to respond to various emergency scenarios such as fire or abandon ship.\nAfter all this training, guess what else is full, their minds stuffed full of important information! Some of it will stick, some will be lost during a restful night of sleep. But these lessons will become second nature as the days at sea go by and the sailing/scientific mission progresses. Soon the students will be seasoned salts speaking a new language and describing the strange customs of the sailing research vessel SSV Corwith Cramer.\nSo please stay tuned and follow along in our adventures in the days to come.\nCheers\nSchelly,\nChief Scientist - Jeffrey M.

After a day full of learning the ways of the ship, nothing better than a full night of sleep for the students. Today began with an amazing breakfast of blueberry pancakes with hand-whipped cream, sausage and fruit thanks to our amazing stewards Raechel and Sebastian. Then, it was time for the main event – let’s go sailing!\nWe cast off our dock lines, pulled in the fenders, and made our way to a quieter anchorage in Nantucket Sound! It was a lovely sail in light winds with clear, sunny skies! A picture-perfect setting for setting our first sails, taking turns at the helm, climbing in the head rig, and practicing our science deployments. It has been a day full of learning, full of tasty food and full of smiles.\nNow that everyone is familiar with their new home you will start to hear from the students directly.

Sunny, clear skies.\nMonday morning we woke up and finished packing our duffels and got a surprise visit from Brooks, Heidi T, John B, and Derek. We ate breakfast all as a group and then went for a walk to the beach with Heidi, JB and Derek. We came back to the ‘North Pole’ at SEA. The crew (us) helped toss packed duffle bags and backpacks into the Proctor van. My bag was so heavy but I was able to fit my fowlies and all of my gear in with my shoes and boots tied to the side. I was not on watch, so after lunch, which was leftover pizza and sandwiches, I was able to chill with Riley and Cass and accidentaly fell asleep. But when they got up to be the first group to the Ship. I woke\nup and was a part of the first shuttle to the boat. Cass, Ryan, Tallulah, Sophie, Riley and I were the first group. Once we got to the dock, we found all of our bags in a pile on the dock and collected and dragged ours to the gangway. Johnny the chief mate told us what we were doing and then Ryan was the first aboard, Cass was the second and I was the third. I came down through the Mid Science ladder and got my bunk assignment. I usually have the worst luck so I was expecting to not get a great bunk but to my surprise, I got the best bunk and the best bunk mate, Ryan! I am not directly in the Saloon or the head; I am right in-between next to the galley entrance. I am on the top bunk and have the most storage space than any other bunk. I defiantly couldn’t use all of the space I was given so for folks whose bunks could not fit their duffels after unpacking, I stored in my bunk. Some student’s barely got any space so I was more than happy to help out! It turns out this bunk has a nick name… ‘The Princess Bunk’. I slept great the first night, the professional crew was so nice and let us all get a full night of sleep before we set sail.\nFirst Actual Day: I woke up from a great night of sleep! ‘A’ watch was on first to help get the boat ready for departure. I was accidentally woken up because Madi Zhan is ‘A’ watch and I (Mattie Dickinson) is on ‘B’ watch. Funny right! Oh well it wasn’t the worst because I was able to get to the head before the rush! Then I got some Tea and waited for my watch to get breakfast. Once breakfast was down the hatch, all hands to deck were called to set sail. Since I am on ‘B’ watch our job was fendering; we held the lines the fenders were on and helped walk and bump the boat out of the dock. Jen the director at SEA and SEA faculty watched us leave Woods hole and say goodbye.\nFirst Leg Underway: We have finally set sail after 3 ½ weeks of waiting! We traveled a few hours to Nantucket and anchored for the night. During the day we did 2 hour watch shifts so everyone knew or had an idea on the jobs and positions we have on watch. We learned how to stand lookout, do a boat check, science deployments and stand helm. Once we were done with first rounds of the intro watches we ate some dinner. The overnight into the next day, ‘C’ and ‘A’ watch had 2 hour watch shifts from 1900 – 0700. Then ‘B’ watch (Noah, Teo, Liam, Tess, Paige, Riley, and Me) stood watch for 6 hours after a rare all-nighter of sleep. It was exhausting. We were relieved at 1300 and got some lunch. I took a good but quick nap from 1330-1415. Then we had an all hands meeting and received a weather, science, and navigation report. While the reporting, we were interrupted multiple times with dolphins, whales, sharks and Mola mola’s (sunfish). Those sightings continued throughout the afternoon. I am sitting here on deck waiting 45 minutes for dinner before I sleep from 1830-2330 for my 0100-0700 watch. My hands are tired and sore like the rest of my body. They have started to call us from all the line handling. And guess what…!!!! WE GOT MAIL TODAY!!!!! All of us were so excited to receive mail!!! So keep it coming!!\nMattie ‘24 \nThursday, October 5, 2023\nNoon Position (Lat and Long): 42deg 00.08N x 68deg 13.827W\nShip Heading (degrees): 300 deg Ship Speed (knots): 1.3 kts Log (nm): 151.4 NM\nWeather /Wind / Sail Plan (from 1300 Watch Change): Wind( SWxS BF2), 10 degrees C, Foggy\nDescription of location: Soling in the Gulf of Maine, presently over Franklin Basin, headed toward Gloucester to wait out Tropical Storm Philippe.\nYesterday (October 4th) was probably one of the best days we have had so far, we were anchored just outside of Nantucket and had our routine anchor watches. Cole, Hillary and I had our two hour anchor watch starting at 5am till 7am. During that time we logged hourly anchor and weather reports and got to watch an awesome sunset right over the Nantucket shore lines. After our watch was up we walked into the saloon welcomed with an amazing breakfast by our stews Rachel and Seb. After breakfast I got to catch up on sleep and prepare myself for my watch that night from 19:00-1:00. I spent most of the day sitting up on the headrig with Whis, Emma and Soph(who are also on A watch). All of us ended up taking a nap and waking up hours later to swells rocking the ship up and down. While the other groups were on watch they overall spotted 3 whales, a Great White shark, 2 Mola Mola and lots of other sea organisms. \nThe best part of the night was around dinner time when the sun was setting, colors of orange and blues filled the sky and nothing but ocean waves surrounded us for miles. We sat up above the lab ate dinner and watched stars fill into the sky while the sun entered into the horizon.\nThen A watch had their first 6 hour watch from 19:00-1:00. Some people were on deck while Cass and I were in lab, we got to filter chlorophyll-a and use our neuston net to catch bioluminescent little fish and any organism that was laying on the surface. Sophie was on look out around 22:00 when she called all of us over because there was a pod of dolphins swimming around and in front of our bow, the bioluminescence made them look like they were glowing in the water as they jumped in and out. It was definitely one of the best things to ever witness on night watch.\nFast forward to today (October 5) we have gained a lot of nautical miles under our vessel, I was woken up to the sound of the fog alarm. It's every two minutes and very very annoying blowing one long horn then two short quickly after. That went on for most of the day until the evening when we had mostly clear skies and a wind Beaufort of 2ish. Shortly after we learned that we had to change courses and instead of making our way up to Nova Scotia we have to make a short stop in Gloucester Massachusetts, because of a tropical storm passing through our route. \nBy going to Mass. we will be able to anchor there for the night and avoid the winds and heavy seas. My night quietly ended with finishing up afternoon watch on forward lookout and enjoying the sunset. Or at least I thought until just after dinner when Jackson called everyone up on deck to watch Elon Musk's newly launched satellites traverse the sky. There were more than 20 following one after another moving across the sky until they faded away. They looked like little shooting stars connected to each other or as Tess would say it looked like Santa's reindeer flying through the sky. Stars filled the entire sky and it was clear enough to see outlines of the Milky Way. 10/10 experience.\nMadi ‘25\nFriday, 6 October 2023\nNoon Position (Lat and Long): 42deg 28.012 N x 070deg 20.82 W\nShip Heading(degrees): 134.4 deg Ship Speed (knots): Anchored at 17:00 Log (nm): 275.6\nWeather / Wind / Sail Plan (from 1300 Watch Change): Constant BF of 2, wind coming from SW-SE all day, constant sea direction-SE, constant temp-17 degrees C\nDescription of location: Anchored at 17:00 in Gloucester MA\nAfter our first few days of sun and light winds that came with beautiful sunsets and many animal sightings, forecasted fog has caught up with us. The beginning of my day along with the rest of C watch started at 1:00 AM. I was on lab with Cade and Lily where we caught up on our latest Neuston net tow that B watch had deployed the watch before (1900-0100). We examined our tow by first picking out each organism that was over 2cm. The biggest thing we noted from this catch was the lack in biodiversity, usually there would be many various organisms, but our catch only consisted of euphausids (krill), and copepods. After we sorted through the catch, we did a 100 count of all our zooplankton from the Neuston tow to get a general consensus of the diversity. After we logged that info, we collected more samples from the water and put them through a chlorophyll-a filtration system that will allow us to measure those amounts. After that, we prepared our science report for class later in the day, did some line handling, and made a to-do list for the next watch which basically concluded our lab watch.\nAfter getting a few more hours of sleep, I woke up and wrote a whole bunch of letters with some of B and C watch, and helped prepare for morning snack which was prepared by our stews, Seb and Rachel. After the first shower of the trip along with a short nap, I was ready for class. We got the news that we were significantly close to Gloucester Mass, and would be anchoring in the harbor until Sunday/Monday to avoid tropical storm Philippe coming our way. Then Ryan and Isabel did a weather report, Whis and Cass did a nav report, and Lily Cade and I did our science report. After class we did some practice sail handling while entering the Gloucester Harbor. \nWhen we anchored everyone was so relieved because we were switched to 2 hour watches instead of our usual 6. As the sun started to come down, Ian, Myles, Emma, Whis, Madi, Sophie, Lily and I embroidered our sweatshirts, and read on the lab roof. Then I changed into my overalls so me and Madi could match and take flicks. We were just hanging out when a big wedding cruise passed us and we had to say hi and a big congrats while they circled us. After this, we had delicious pizza made by Seb, Rachel, and Jackson who was the student steward of the day, it was so good. After dinner, Ryan and I had our two hour anchor watch which was full of anchor checks, boat checks, and practicing all of our lines. Finally, after a lotta laughs, we got through it and now I'm writing my blog. Overall it was a gross and foggy day, but our group made the best of it and we had a blast anyways like usual.\nTallulah '25\nSunday, 8 October 2023\nNoon Position: (Lat and Long): 42DEG 35.7'n X 070DEG 40.1'W\nShip Heading (degrees): 075 deg Ship Speed (knots): 8 knots Log (nm): 276.1nm\nWeather /Wind / Sail Plan at 1400: Winds SSW BF 4, broad reach on starboard tack, Single-reefed mains'l, main and fore stays'ls, foretopsail and raffee\nDescription of location: ~10 NE of Gloucester Harbor\nIt was a busy weekend anchored in Gloucester Harbor as we sheltered from Tropical Storm Philippe. Since we had already cleared out of the US bound\nfor Canadian waters, we were not permitted to go ashore. However, that did not slow us down. Still plenty to do and learn even at anchor while aboard the Cramer. We took advantage of our comfortable anchorage to hold the infamous Pin Chase - time when students demonstrate how many of the lines they have learned onboard the ship. It is a friendly relay race among the Watches, a bit of competition to encourage their learning. Though I don't recall which Watch found all of the lines first, the true winners are all of us. It was clear that everyone is learning their lines and that means we can set more sails and the captain can feel confident in leaving them up longer even when the winds pick up.\nWe also used this time to train students in the proper way to climb aloft in the rigging and to continue our scientific investigations in a unique coastal setting. Our nets were full of young crab larvae, the seafloor sediments were full of small worms burrowing in the mud (good holding for our anchor!), and our secchi disc went no deeper than 4 meters because of all the productive phytoplankton growing nearshore. And of course, the entire time the students were keeping Cramer safe with hourly boat checks, weather observations, and making sure our anchor was holding, even when TS Philippe passed by in the middle of the night.\nToday, as I write this, the winds have abated, the sun is shining and we are making way toward Nova Scotia once again.\nChief Scientist Jeffrey M.

Overall it was a gross and foggy day, but our group made the best of it and we had a blast anyways like usual.\n\nTallulah '25\n\n## Sunday, 8 October 2023\n\nNoon Position: (Lat and Long):  42DEG 35.7'n X 070DEG 40.1'W  \nShip Heading (degrees):  075 deg Ship Speed (knots):  8 knots Log (nm): 276.1nm  \nWeather /Wind / Sail Plan at 1400:  Winds SSW BF 4, broad reach on starboard tack, Single-reefed mains'l, main and fore stays'ls, foretopsail and raffee  \nDescription of location:  ~10 NE of Gloucester Harbor\n\nIt was a busy weekend anchored in Gloucester Harbor as we sheltered from Tropical Storm Philippe.  Since we had already cleared out of the US bound  \nfor Canadian waters, we were not permitted to go ashore.  However, that did not slow us down.  Still plenty to do and learn even at anchor while aboard the Cramer.  We took advantage of our comfortable anchorage to hold the infamous Pin Chase - time when students demonstrate how many of the lines they have learned onboard the ship.  It is a friendly relay race among the Watches, a bit of competition to encourage their learning.  Though I don't recall which Watch found all of the lines first, the true winners are all of us.  It was clear that everyone is learning their lines and that means we can set more sails and the captain can feel confident in leaving them up longer even when the winds pick up.\n\nWe also used this time to train students in the proper way to climb aloft in the rigging and to continue our scientific investigations in a unique coastal setting.  Our nets were full of young crab larvae, the seafloor sediments were full of small worms burrowing in the mud (good holding for our anchor!), and our secchi disc went no deeper than 4 meters because of all the productive phytoplankton growing nearshore.  And of course, the entire time the students were keeping Cramer safe with hourly boat checks, weather observations, and making sure our anchor was holding, even when TS Philippe passed by in the middle of the night.  \nToday, as I write this, the winds have abated, the sun is shining and we are making way toward Nova Scotia once again.\n\nChief Scientist Jeffrey M. Schell\n\n## [Check out more photos from Ocean Classroom 2023!](https://www.flickr.com/photos/proctoracademy/albums/72177720311054613)"

  "text": "Proctor en Segovia students have returned home, reuniting with their families. Before leaving Segovia, Spain, Liam '24, Sophie M. '25, and Stella '25 took a moment to reflect on their experience as their final days in Segovia unfolded. Often, the small, undocumented moments and daily decisions, aggregated over a term of living and learning abroad, resonate most powerfully. Congratulations to the fall 2023 Proctor en Segovia group for wholeheartedly embracing the immersion experience, discovering so much about themselves in the process.\nLiam '24 - Life in Spain: An Experiential Journey\nBack in May, about two weeks before school got out, Bill told me about a late opening for Spain in the fall. He told me about the opening on a Friday and I had my application in by Monday. I was told that a few other students also put in an application, but I secured the spot. I was so ridiculously excited and couldn't wait to see what the fall held for me in Spain. My time here in Spain was one I will never forget. I strived to immerse myself in the culture as much as possible, improve my Spanish knowledge and speaking skills, and see what self-improvement I could achieve. Every single one of those goals was reached on this trip. \nI am so glad that I pushed myself to immerse myself into the culture as much as possible here in Spain because by doing so, I also pushed myself outside of my comfort zone, which is self-improvement as well. The first part of Spain that I took advantage of was building a strong relationship with Luján. I know this isn't easy for some, but I totally lucked out with having Luján as my host mom because she is truly the best and super cool. Thankfully, even from the beginning of this trip, I had solid conversational skills, so I was able to communicate with Luján, who doesn't speak a lick of English. We began to build a close relationship, and I felt very comfortable with her. Luján is also very social and knows about all of the events going on in Segovia, so every time she was going to an event she would ask if I wanted to go as well and every time I said yes and went with her. Throughout our eight weeks together we went to three concerts, the Oktoberfest event, lunch with her and her best friend, Carmen, twice, and a puppeteering event in a rock climbing gym way out in New Segovia with the most progressive scene in Segovia. Saying yes was so beneficial because every time I went with her somewhere, I got to experience something new and something that I wouldn't have heard about without her. The second thing I'm glad I immersed myself in was deciding to take a dance class. It was a class for flamenquito which is a more relaxed party style of Flamenco dancing. It was the first dance class I had ever taken and I was the youngest person in the room by at least five to ten years and the only American, obviously. The class was so incredibly fun and I got to learn some really fun moves and got some great Spanish songs as well. \nSophie M. '25 - Final Reflections\nFrom learning how to just say yes and experience new things to trying something new and learning how to enjoy doing things by myself, this trip has been immensely helpful to my inner self and how I perceive the world around me. I couldn't be thankful enough to have been able to have this unique experience in Spain, especially in the circumstances of how it was all able to happen.\nSitting on a bus ride back from Madrid, I can't comprehend that in two days, I will be back in the U.S. Last night, my host family gave me a beautiful necklace with my initials on it, and it made me really come to terms with how lucky I have been to be a part of this experiment and in such a thoughtful family.\nAt first, things were pretty awkward. Living with another family is never going to be seamless, but without them, I really don't know where I'd be at the end of this trip (without money, that's for sure!). \nAs for my Spanish, I think I have made incredible strides. I remember feeling so lost on the first day, unable to communicate my thoughts. In my learning process, there have been a few funny/embarrassing moments. For example, not knowing how to turn the lights back on in the house and spending hours in complete darkness! But at the end of my time in Segovia, I feel more than prepared to communicate in any possible situation.\nI think that is more important than just being book-smart. The main factor that contributed to my personal growth was my exploration of new places. Even though I was convinced that I was going to hate the walking portion of The Camino, it actually ended up being my favorite part. I felt closer to the group than ever, strong athletically and stimulated mentally. Being able to experience different towns/environments in one day on foot was something I have never thought was possible. Even though the weekend trips were my highlight, I also appreciated getting into a personal routine at home.\nOf course, the traveling weekend trips were my highlight, but I also really appreciated getting into a personal routine at home. In general, the trips really made me feel like I was studying abroad and not just traveling as a tourist. It gave me the opportunity to have an army of personal freedom while still belonging to a cohesive learning environment. It gave me a lot of practice adapting to a new environment and learning about a whole new culture.\nStella '25 - Remember the Memories, Not the Photos\nI'm alone in a dark room, scrolling through the countless photos on my phone from the last two incredible months I spent living in Segovia, Spain. As I scroll, the images transport me back, but it feels like it all happened so quickly. While the pictures prove I was there, my memories don't always match the vivid scenes. It's the moments I never captured with my camera that I can vividly recall. The familiar street I walked up and down daily, the majestic aqueduct, and the three different kinds of bus drivers whose faces I recognized but whose names remained a mystery. In these ordinary experiences, I discovered the true essence of my Spanish adventure.\nCelebrating a birthday at the school in Segovia!\nI walked the same street to and from school every day; it took me ten minutes to get to the big aqueduct and an additional ten minutes to get to Plaza Mayor, where school sits. I could have walked that street with my eyes closed shut and remembering every bend and every corner with precise accuracy. It was never important enough or aesthetic enough to capture in a photo, but now, as I walk it for the last time, I realize how much time I spent walking that street. Lauren, Marion, and I walked that street together, and every time, we grew a little closer to each other. We had deep conversations as we returned home at 11:45 pm. We laughed till our stomachs hurt and rumbled on our way to la comida. We walked in silence on the cold mornings. We never stopped to enjoy our humble surroundings, which included the stone aqueduct we frequently crossed. \nWe passed the stone aqueduct countless times, but until these last few days, I never looked up at it in thought. I had knowledge about it but never processed the size of the stone, the height, or the fact that it has no kind of solution between the rock layers holding it together; it just stands there. I never took a photo of it until now. I found it in the background of some photos, but I never thought I would want to remember what it looked like from my point of view. \nThe bus beckoned as the days grew shorter and the air got sharper, finally becoming a necessary part of my everyday routine. At 9:00 am, I would leave my home to meet Marion at the corner to walk to our bus stop. 9:06, the bus would stop, and Lauren would get on. Then at 9:08, the bus would stop again, and Marion and I would get on this time. I would scan my red bus card and smile as I said \"hola\" to 1 of 3 bus drivers. The first was older, with a round face, thick eyebrows, and blue eyes; the second was shiny and bald, with brown hair and a coarse beard; and the third was younger, with tight, clear skin, thick eyebrows, and blue eyes. Their gracious faces are emblazoned in my mind, even if they serve as the intermediaries between home and school; their names, histories, and even pictures escape me.\nThe memories come flooding back as I sit by myself in my dark room and sift through the hundreds of pictures from my trip to Segovia, Spain. The photos attest to my presence, yet it all happened so quickly. The uncaptured moments hold more significance -- the everyday strolls along well-known roads, the magnificent aqueduct, and the anonymous bus drivers who eventually became recognizable figures. It was in these everyday encounters that I discovered the real purpose of my trip to Spain. Now that I'm thinking back, I see how important the little things, the jokes, and the quiet strolls were. I realize how I need to appreciate all the little things in my life just as much as I appreciate the big things because when they are taken away, all you will have are the memories. A series of recollections richer in detail than any snapshot.\n\"Gracias Segovia\"\nCHECK OUT MORE PHOTOS FROM PROCTOR EN SEGOVIA, FALL 2023!",

But at the end of my time in Segovia, I feel more than prepared to communicate in any possible situation.\n\n![Proctor Academy Spanish immersion classroom](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1700923484/proctoracademyorg/ctvhgz2kugv4qnrrfwv6/RosasSpanishClassFall23.jpg)\n\nI think that is more important than just being book-smart. The main factor that contributed to my personal growth was my exploration of new places. Even though I was convinced that I was going to hate the walking portion of The Camino, it actually ended up being my favorite part. I felt closer to the group than ever, strong athletically and stimulated mentally. Being able to experience different towns/environments in one day on foot was something I have never thought was possible. Even though the weekend trips were my highlight, I also appreciated getting into a personal routine at home.\n\nOf course, the traveling weekend trips were my highlight, but I also really appreciated getting into a personal routine at home. In general, the trips really made me feel like I was studying abroad and not just traveling as a tourist. It gave me the opportunity to have an army of personal freedom while still belonging to a cohesive learning environment. It gave me a lot of practice adapting to a new environment and learning about a whole new culture.\n\n## Stella '25 - Remember the Memories, Not the Photos\n\nI'm alone in a dark room, scrolling through the countless photos on my phone from the last two incredible months I spent living in Segovia, Spain. As I scroll, the images transport me back, but it feels like it all happened so quickly. While the pictures prove I was there, my memories don't always match the vivid scenes. It's the moments I never captured with my camera that I can vividly recall. The familiar street I walked up and down daily, the majestic aqueduct, and the three different kinds of bus drivers whose faces I recognized but whose names remained a mystery. In these ordinary experiences, I discovered the true essence of my Spanish adventure.  \n \n\nCelebrating a birthday at the school in Segovia!\n\nI walked the same street to and from school every day; it took me ten minutes to get to the big aqueduct and an additional ten minutes to get to Plaza Mayor, where school sits. I could have walked that street with my eyes closed shut and remembering every bend and every corner with precise accuracy. It was never important enough or aesthetic enough to capture in a photo, but now, as I walk it for the last time, I realize how much time I spent walking that street. Lauren, Marion, and I walked that street together, and every time, we grew a little closer to each other. We had deep conversations as we returned home at 11:45 pm. We laughed till our stomachs hurt and rumbled on our way to la comida. We walked in silence on the cold mornings. We never stopped to enjoy our humble surroundings, which included the stone aqueduct we frequently crossed. \n\nWe passed the stone aqueduct countless times, but until these last few days, I never looked up at it in thought. I had knowledge about it but never processed the size of the stone, the height, or the fact that it has no kind of solution between the rock layers holding it together; it just stands there. I never took a photo of it until now. I found it in the background of some photos, but I never thought I would want to remember what it looked like from my point of view. \n\nThe bus beckoned as the days grew shorter and the air got sharper, finally becoming a necessary part of my everyday routine. At 9:00 am, I would leave my home to meet Marion at the corner to walk to our bus stop. 9:06, the bus would stop, and Lauren would get on. Then at 9:08, the bus would stop again, and Marion and I would get on this time. I would scan my red bus card and smile as I said \"hola\" to 1 of 3 bus drivers. The first was older, with a round face, thick eyebrows, and blue eyes; the second was shiny and bald, with brown hair and a coarse beard; and the third was younger, with tight, clear skin, thick eyebrows, and blue eyes. Their gracious faces are emblazoned in my mind, even if they serve as the intermediaries between home and school; their names, histories, and even pictures escape me.\n\nThe memories come flooding back as I sit by myself in my dark room and sift through the hundreds of pictures from my trip to Segovia, Spain. The photos attest to my presence, yet it all happened so quickly. The uncaptured moments hold more significance -- the everyday strolls along well-known roads, the magnificent aqueduct, and the anonymous bus drivers who eventually became recognizable figures. It was in these everyday encounters that I discovered the real purpose of my trip to Spain. Now that I'm thinking back, I see how important the little things, the jokes, and the quiet strolls were. I realize how I need to appreciate all the little things in my life just as much as I appreciate the big things because when they are taken away, all you will have are the memories. A series of recollections richer in detail than any snapshot.\n\n \"Gracias Segovia\"\n\n[CHECK OUT MORE PHOTOS FROM PROCTOR EN SEGOVIA, FALL 2023!](https://www.flickr.com/photos/proctoracademy/albums/72177720311251335)"

  "text": "Often, Proctor en Segovia students punctuate a trimester of living and learning abroad with a trip to southern Spain with resident program directors. This term, Alejandra and Ross and the Fall 2023 Proctor en Segovia group traveled to Sevilla, Andalucía, a city that certainly has 'personality,' a complex history, and a rich cultural heritage. Learning is perhaps most powerful when students who have been engaging with material for weeks are given the opportunity to experience it first-hand in daily life and by visiting monuments and museums.\nKhadija '25 - A Journey of Senses in Sevilla\nSevilla is a city where the sun's warmth embraces your skin, where history is everywhere you look, and where every step leads to a different feeling. I stepped off the bus in Sevilla and instantly felt the warmth on my skin. It was a big change from the chill in Segovia. It was a mood booster, to say the least, and it put me in a happy state of mind. Sevilla had a charm that went beyond just the weather. It was a city where history and amazing architecture merged in ways that blew my mind. As we roamed around, I found myself in awe at the incredible churches and cathedrals. The detailed carvings, majestic domes, and colorful stained-glass windows and 'azulejos' or tiles were beautiful. I'd seen historic sites in Segovia, but Sevilla's architectural wonders were a whole new level of greatness.\nThe one that stood out was the Real Alcázar of Sevilla, the royal palace. It was like a beautiful blend of different architectural styles, from Islamic to Gothic and Renaissance. Walking through its halls and peaceful gardens with their perfect bushes was so pleasing to my eyes that we couldn't help but take tons of pictures. The city was huge, and every turn felt like a new surprise. The streets were like a maze of charming alleys, cozy cafes, and colorful shops. I might've gone a little overboard with shopping and ended up with a bag full of clothes.\nThe city's vibe was just something else. As I strolled through it, I was greeted by palm trees blowing in the warm breeze. It felt like a tropical paradise, and it was hard not to be excited. It was the kind of experience that made me appreciate the warmth and the sense of summer in my bones. But Sevilla had a unique scent, too. The air was filled with all sorts of smells, reminding me a bit of the busy streets in summertime Boston. There was the aroma of street food, flowers, and every now and then, a whiff of the citrus fruits. But there was one smell that stood out – the not-so-pleasant odor of manure from the horses that pull carriages the many carriages around the city for the tourists. Sevilla was a magical mix of different things, from its jaw-dropping historic sites to its lively streets. It brought me back to Summer, which is when I'm happiest. My short time there was a journey that was uplifting, and it gave me an even wider lens into Spanish culture and history. \nEli '24 - Comparing Sevilla and New York City\nUpon traveling to Seville, I was instantly struck with a sense of familiarity. Although it was my first time visiting this city, I felt closer to home (New York City) than I had been in Segovia. As I immersed myself in the enchanting streets and absorbed the vibrant culture of Seville, I couldn't help but draw parallels between the two cities, recognizing shared traits that made me feel surprisingly at home. One of the first aspects that struck me was the dynamic energy that exists within both Seville and New York. The lively streets of Seville, accompanied by colorful buildings and a constant chatter of locals, mirrored the same \"vibe\" of Manhattan or the lively neighborhoods of my neighborhood in Brooklyn. It was definitely a contrast to the atmosphere of Segovia, which seemed to move at a slower pace. In Seville, the constant noise brought me back to my life in the Big Apple.\nThe culinary scene in Seville also struck a chord of familiarity. The diverse array of tapas bars and restaurants was comparable to the multicultural culinary landscape of New York. Whether eating Spanish, Italian, or even Mexican food, I found the same spirit of experimentation in Seville as I do in New York. In Seville, much like in New York, the people became the heartbeat of the city. The warmth and friendliness of the locals created an immediate sense of community, reminiscent of the diverse and welcoming neighborhoods scattered across New York's five boroughs. During one of our local excursions, my friends and I encountered street performers who reminded me a lot of the ones back home. The people here, including the street performers, shared the same friendliness and energy as the people in New York.\nThe arts also played a significant role in shaping my Sevillian experience, drawing parallels to the vibrant cultural scene of New York. Seville's rich history of flamenco and its visual art scene, showcased in museums and gardens, echoed the pieces found in the galleries of Chelsea or the theaters of Broadway. Both relatively old cities for their countries, Seville and New York share many similarities in this regard. As my time in Seville unfolded, it became increasingly evident that, despite the geographical and cultural differences, the city was greatly similar to my home city of New York. Despite visiting Madrid prior to this trip, I never felt so close to home before visiting Seville.\nMarion '25 - Beauty in Every Corner \nWhen we first arrived in Sevilla, I was surprised by the temperature change. Although it was only a ten-degree difference, it felt much hotter. We waited for the bus to arrive and bring us to the hostel. After we had put our things down, we met with one of the Spanish teachers' friends. His name was José, and he showed us around the city. He took us past the cathedral and the castle, which sat very close to each other. Both were very pretty, but my favorite part was walking the narrow streets. Looking down at them, the porches on either side were inches apart.\nOver the next couple of days, we visited the church and the cathedral, and walked to the top of the tower of the cathedral. Since it was a tour, we learned a lot about the construction; interestingly, the construction of all the stained windows and arches was mapped out by the Romans on the roof. There were multiple levels to look out from on the cathedral, but when we stood at the top, the whole city was visible. All of the buildings we could see were beautiful, along with their terraces. Afterwards, we walked inside the castle, and the square, and all of the tiles on both the facade and the interior of the castle were gorgeous. We spent a lot of time walking around and admiring the structures that had been built so long ago. It was very different from anything we would see in the United States. Everywhere we walked in The Real Alcázar was full of history and beautiful arabesque designs and architecture. It was certainly a great place to see the past being reflected in the construction and design of the castle.\nHenry '25 - Exploring the Rich Tapestry of Sevilla\nLast weekend, my Proctor group and I visited Sevilla, a city steeped in history and culture. We explored iconic landmarks like the General Archive of the Indies, The Cathedral of Sevilla, Real Alcázar, and the Plaza de España. Each site had its unique charm and rich history, captivating us with its stories. We also enjoyed Sevilla's famous cuisine, indulging in delicious meals at charming restaurants. One night, we tried a special pasta dish unique to the city, savoring its flavors and cultural essence.\\\nLooking back, this trip was unforgettable. Sevilla's blend of history, art, and food left a lasting impression on us. I highly recommend this enchanting city to fellow travelers, as it offers a captivating journey into Spain's cultural heritage.\nCheck out more photos from Proctor en Segovia, Fall 2023!",

  "text": "Hannah L. '25 - Plaza de España (Sevilla)\nThe second day in Sevilla was incredible. We started off the day walking through a beautiful park. I could smell the fresh air circulating through the tall trees and oranges falling everywhere. I look ahead of me and see an opening. We walk through a green arch covered in plants and enter a half circle of the most beautiful plaza. This was the Plaza de España. The plaza had the most magnificent fountain in the center where, once in a while, I could feel the mist carried by the wind land on my face. The chilling sensation of the mist was calming. If you looked at the fountain at the right angle, you could see a rainbow towering above. There was a channel close to the main building surrounding the entire plaza. Many bridges were connecting us to the center and over these channels. Thinking about the past and what they were able to create and accomplish completely boggles my mind. The questions go on and on, and I find myself appreciating these landmarks even more. As I entered the sun, the beams hit my face, and I felt revived with a sunny, hot feeling I had longed for all winter. \nThat day, we were also able to experience the river cruise. Sitting at the front of the boat, listening to the history of all the remarkable buildings with the hot sun beating down on our faces, trying to get our freckles back, was priceless. I looked over the river and saw people rowing and sailing. I thought to myself how much fun it would be to jump in. After the slight burn on my face, we walked over to the bullfighting arena. We walked about and towards the stands. The sun was hitting one side of the stadium, and the other was shaded. Walking around the arena, in the center, you could see old blood stains from past bulls. \nEthan '25 - Flamenco and a Night in Sevilla\n\nA night in Sevilla can consist of walking in the city, watching a flamenco show, or walking around the famous cathedral. The second night was my favorite, even though all the nights were fun. The plan was for us to watch a flamenco show and then have dinner. We left the hotel early to visit the Museum of Flamenco. The flamenco show was amazing. There were three dancers, two singers, and a guitarist. The male dancer was drenched in sweat, and the girls sitting in the front row got some of it on them whenever he spun around. We joked about the \"splash zone\" during dinner at an amazing Mexican restaurant. \nAfter dinner, we were given forty-five minutes of free time, and a few of us wanted to have more fun. So, we rented scooters and explored the city. It was such a good idea! We rode around for about 20 minutes before deciding to head back to our hotel. Back in our room, the boys did some homework for a little while. Then, we just talked and messed around. It was a simple night, but it was a lot of fun. The mix of watching flamenco, enjoying a delicious dinner, riding scooters, and hanging out in the room made it a night to remember in Sevilla.\nThomas '25 - Exploring Sevilla at Night\nAfter eating dinner at an excellent restaurant, the group has decisions to make as we have a fun night ahead of us. The city is filled with people and different scenes everywhere you look. The second I glanced over and locked eyes with the electric scooters, I knew that's what I wanted to do with my time. All the boys ran down the stairs, and we were ready for an adventure. We then traveled around parts of the city. The wind blowing in your face as you are going so fast down the paths of Sevilla was unlike any other. The time spent exploring and going where the trail took us felt like the right time to do that because this led us to see many new and incredible places while on this trip.

The temperature drops, and so does the number of people. Staring up at the sky when there are lights of different colors made it seem like it came straight out of a movie. During these nights, I have started to embrace the more minor things, such as the scooter rides, late-night walks, and dinners out with the group. These moments have made me realize how memorable this trip and experience have been. \nMorgan '25 - Excerpt from Final Reflections\nThe past two months in Segovia, Spain, have been unforgettable and life-changing. The journey has been something I will never take for granted. Living and adapting to a new culture may seem scary, but I will savor every moment.

My little laughs with my host sister during every meal and talking about soccer with my host brother whenever the time came (almost every day) were little things I would cherish forever. \nViews of Segovia from the Monasterio de Santa María del Parral\nWe got to take many excursions around Spain and visit more Spanish culture. We visited Barcelona, Valencia, Salamanca, Madrid three times, and Sevilla. I loved every place we visited, but the sights and memories from Barcelona were the best. We also got a chance to participate in many afternoon activities: gym, metal art, yoga, cooking class, and painting class. These were all amazing chances to meet new people, learn new things, and meet incredible people. \nMy all-time favorite activity was metal class. Jesús is one of the most creative and hilarious people I have ever met. His love and enthusiasm for his work are inspiring, and I am so grateful I got to meet him. Reflecting on my time here, I can truly see self-growth in many ways. One major one is not being scared of trying new things and saying yes to every opportunity that comes my way. Doing this made my experience 10x better, and looking back, I do not regret anything I did, only the things I did not get to do. I am so grateful I got to experience Spain and its culture and I 100% will visit again. \nReese '25 - Excerpt from Final Reflections\nGoing into Spain, I didn't know how big of an impact it would have on my life. However, after being in Spain for the past two months, I have faced many challenges that I have grown to overcome.

Everywhere we went, I saw incredible architecture that left me enamored with the design and tiny details. Although we have gone to some great places, I think the great outcome of being in Spain was the mental growth I have gained. Being able to change my perspective of everyday life in Spain by getting to see firsthand how people live within different cultures and backgrounds has been huge.

'25 - Plaza de España (Sevilla)\n\nThe second day in Sevilla was incredible. We started off the day walking through a beautiful park. I could smell the fresh air circulating through the tall trees and oranges falling everywhere. I look ahead of me and see an opening. We walk through a green arch covered in plants and enter a half circle of the most beautiful plaza. This was the Plaza de España. The plaza had the most magnificent fountain in the center where, once in a while, I could feel the mist carried by the wind land on my face. The chilling sensation of the mist was calming. If you looked at the fountain at the right angle, you could see a rainbow towering above. There was a channel close to the main building surrounding the entire plaza. Many bridges were connecting us to the center and over these channels. Thinking about the past and what they were able to create and accomplish completely boggles my mind. The questions go on and on, and I find myself appreciating these landmarks even more. As I entered the sun, the beams hit my face, and I felt revived with a sunny, hot feeling I had longed for all winter. \n\n![Proctor Academy Experiential Learning in Spain](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1709497533/proctoracademyorg/dtp9lxcvwgxkmdnrlrzk/PlazadeEspana2.jpg)\n\nThat day, we were also able to experience the river cruise. Sitting at the front of the boat, listening to the history of all the remarkable buildings with the hot sun beating down on our faces, trying to get our freckles back, was priceless. I looked over the river and saw people rowing and sailing. I thought to myself how much fun it would be to jump in. After the slight burn on my face, we walked over to the bullfighting arena. We walked about and towards the stands. The sun was hitting one side of the stadium, and the other was shaded. Walking around the arena, in the center, you could see old blood stains from past bulls. \n\n![Proctor Academy students travel to Sevilla ](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1709497532/proctoracademyorg/cmfika0guendyb5cjlum/PlazadeEspana.jpg)\n\n## Ethan '25 - Flamenco and a Night in Sevilla\n\n  \nA night in Sevilla can consist of walking in the city, watching a flamenco show, or walking around the famous cathedral. The second night was my favorite, even though all the nights were fun. The plan was for us to watch a flamenco show and then have dinner. We left the hotel early to visit the Museum of Flamenco. The flamenco show was amazing. There were three dancers, two singers, and a guitarist. The male dancer was drenched in sweat, and the girls sitting in the front row got some of it on them whenever he spun around.

  "text": "Students from Proctor en Segovia reflected on two distinct cultural immersion experiences: a visit to the Museo del Prado in Madrid, one of Europe's finest and most visited art museums, and Carnival week in Segovia. At El Prado, students selected a favorite master painter and analyzed two of their works.\nMorgan '25 - Hieronymus Bosch \nDoing my pre-research on Hieronymus Bosch, I understood before entering El Prado that there might not be much about Bosch, but oh, was I wrong. After scavenging the enormous museum for 30 minutes, I finally discovered room 56A, Bosch. Entering the room, writing \"Bosch\" on my worksheet, it immediately got knocked out of my hands and onto the floor. As I raised my head after picking up my clipboard, I was flustered with 40-60 people all fitting in one small room. But the weird thing was that they were all surrounded by this painting, \"The Garden of Earthy Delights.\" I made my way over to a painting that caught my eye: \"The Haywain Triptych.\" I read the painting's description and my eyes widened as I understood this painting was also a story told in art form. \n\nAfter reading, I made my way over to the left panel. This fall, Corby Leith taught me about the different layers and details of a painting. I took this knowledge and used it to deconstruct the painting. There were three layers of the painting, a background that included the sky with an angel floating on a cloud, which looked like bugs falling from the cloud. This represented the origin of sins from fallen angels. In the midground, small groups of people were mostly naked on a field with animals. In the foreground were two naked women and a character with a large sword. The midground and foreground represented the origin of sin on Earth, with Adam and Eve being expelled from paradise by Archangel Michael. This is very eye-opening to me because I honestly did not realize a painting could have as much meaning and story to it. \nAs I moved toward the centerpiece, the largest panel, I began to deconstruct the painting and try to guess what the meaning was behind it. I guessed the meaning had to do with humanity and going against each other. The angel was still on her cloud up in the sky, but this time, she was alone. The midground had an enormous haystack with what looked like angles and a small family on top. Surrounding the hay was what I believe poor people in desperate need and wanting of anything. They were trying to climb up the hay to retrieve what they wished for, but this turned into a massive brawl between the people. They were all fighting and killing each other because they all had one common need: sins. The true meaning is mankind in sin trying to avail themselves of the earthly possessions symbolized by the hay. I would say I was close enough. On the right panel, there was a different vibe from the other two. In this panel, inhuman characters were attacking and killing humans and other inhuman characters. In the background, there was a building that I believed was a church on fire. It gave off the vibe that the world was crashing and being taken over by the devil. This panel only represented hell. Overall, the whole painting tells a story through time with the main theme of sins. The left panel was named \"Paradise,\" showing an easy and calm life. With the centerpiece being a mix of both, the family on the hay was calm, but the people surrounding them were becoming crazy. And with the final panel named \"Hell\" shows how the world crashed and humanity broke. I enjoyed reading and looking into this painting and artist because it showed me art can mean so much more than what we see from the outside. \nRyan '24 - Listening Through Seeing\nOnce I figured out how to navigate the maze that is the Museo del Prado, I was able to find room 49: the room with Raphael's work adorning the tall, grand walls. I recognized that I was in the right place when I saw Portrait of the Cardinal, a small piece in comparison to the others but very distinct. Upon realizing I was in the right place, I looked around for my favorite of Raphael's paintings: \"Madonna of the Rose.\" It was smaller than I pictured but even grander than I imagined. As a big fan of Michelangelo, I was able to recognize his obvious influence on Raphael's work in the form of dynamism: using gestures and activity to convey emotion. The Virgin Mary is bright with the obvious tenderness she holds for her child, dressed in a wispy blue, with pink sleeves and a subtle gold halo around her head. Baby Jesus is the most vibrant, wrapped in bold green and blue blankets. Joseph in the back is made of much darker hues. His face is shadowed as he looks down with a furrowed brow, and he is donning dark robes and is not touching Mary or either of the babies. Raphael effectively uses dynamism to reveal so much about the family dynamic through this intentional coloring, hand placements, and facial expressions.\nAfter moving on from Madonna of the Rose, I went to view more of Raphael's work. I was simultaneously intrigued and disappointed to find that many of his works were not painted by the man himself, but rather by his students and assistants after he cultivated the outline. Originally, I assumed this meant Raphael was a selfish man who took credit for work that was not fully his, but I later learned that a large aspect of Raphael was his being a teacher. He wanted his pupils to learn, and he did this by helping them create incredible pieces of artwork that he was perfectly capable of doing himself. Due to his unexpected death at age 37, it was likely that in lieu of searching for all the students he worked with, historians simply put Raphael's name over all these paintings. \nOther than Raphael's work, I was also very impressed by the variation of The Last Supper, the first copy of Mona Lisa, and Miracles of the Doctors Saint Cosmas and Damien. El Prado is filled to the brim with the incredible stories that these paintings tell. I was lucky enough to spend an hour and a half of my day looking at them and listening to their stories.\nCarnaval - Owen '24\nDay 2\nAfter coming back from a workout, I walked through the bustling streets that seemed to point towards the Plaza Mayor. I went up the cold stone steps leading up to the main street and took gulping breaths of the fresh cool air and partially cloudy skies. On top of the stairs, clustered groups of friends, lovers, and families conversed about the event taking place. I truly wasn't aware of what was happening, so with my headphones blasting music, I didn't hear the grande trumpets and drums piercing the energetic atmosphere. The more I chugged along, the more people crowded the streets, some wearing a multitude of outfits ranging from Mario to dragons. As I swerved closer, my headphones could not keep out the Carnaval music. Walking then became difficult and bystanders started staring at me, confused as to why I was so adamant about missing this event. Finally, the crowds glued to the sides of buildings prevented my mission of a post-workout meal, though this was a great outcome to be fair. Rows of pink outfits filled the middle, all dancing to the upbeat melody. Like a cult, everyone bobbed in rhythm, the percussive drums reverberating through my chest. Not to mention all of the strollers, with babies that seemed to not be affected by ear-destroying levels of sound. I guess you start them young, because all ages loved every second the parade gifted to us. I passed a small band and people in reptile costumes who danced and sauntered forward to the Plaza. At this point, I felt like a true Segovian, even though, in truth, I was a random student watching the wonderful, cultural, and historic journey filled with a party through town. \nDay 3\nThis was a night I will absolutely cherish and look back on during all of my trips to Spain. After metal art I had been sitting in the school's living room with the rest of the group, all of us awaiting the biggest day of the Carnival. Beforehand I saw a concert stage being set up in front of the cathedral, which meant for a thrilling time to experience! After a bit of conversation and theorizing about our plan, Ross and Ale came to explain how our night would go; the first being that they ordered some good pizzas to fill our stomachs and have energy for some dancing. We could already hear people gathering and speakers blaring Spanish songs through the dark town square, lit up solely by the shining street lamps, and just somehow, the excited souls of Segovia brightened it even more. A couple of us stuck with tradition and grabbed costumes, wigs, and hats, dressing for the occasion, of course, especially considering we would blend in like chorizo in a bocadillo. Ross soon called for a couple of pizza grabbers to help escort some pies into the impatient stomachs of our group, so Brendan and I instantly devoted ourselves to guards of some good Italian slices. We arrived at DaMario, grabbed four boxes each, and headed back out. Apparently, everyone was too preoccupied to notice I was trying to walk through because it took multiple \"pardons\" and body taps so I could get past the hypnotized mob. Once I finally entered the building and all the pizzas were laid out we went to town and devoured many boxes in an almost record time. After this cheesy dinner, we headed back down, out of the school to get the energy up and the hips swaying. As I opened the front door to find the group, I was met with a growing expansion of people, most of them having wonderful outfits. My friends were already dancing to a mini parade group with their float connected to a speaker. I joined them along with Rosa, one of our Spanish teachers, and Ale, who were just as excited and maybe even more excited than we were. The band who had been setting up this whole time started tweaking their instruments to get ready before playing, so we moved towards the front of the stage. The main singer picked up his mic and hyped up the crowd for their performance, possibly talking about giving respect to the Carnival and the people there to enjoy a wonderful show. They started with catchy and clearly popular Spanish songs, loosening up everyone and getting dances flowing. We started clapping our hands together to the beat in unison and using synchronized moves, bringing upbeat energy for hours. As time went by, my body felt fatigued, and then Ale told us to get our stuff and go home, although I wished it never ended. \nAndrew '25 on Carnival\nCarnival is celebrated throughout the entirety of Spain. I call it the Mardi Gras of Spain. Growing up in a very New Orleans traditional house, I expected the streets of Segovia to be the next Bourbon street with all the celebrations, but that was not the case. The first official day of the Carnival began on Saturday, and it continued all through the week. On Monday, I witnessed what was a pre-party, like a rehearsal before a big show. Seeing all the costumes and the blueprints for what was in store for the next day was cool because the Carnival was a free-for-all for the most part. Tuesday was the main event of the Carnival. On Tuesday, the streets were flooded with people from store to store. It felt like everyone from Segovia was wandering the streets in preparation for the parade. The Carnival's main attraction is the parade, composed of multiple groups of people, all complete with a float or some music. The parade began at the aqueduct. It migrated all the way up to Plaza Mayor for the official celebration.\nSeeing most of the parade from the school balcony was cool because you could observe everything from an aerial view instead of being elbow to elbow with what seemed like everyone within a 20-mile radius. After the parade, it surprised me; there was a cover concert right smack down in front of the cathedral, where arguably the group had the most fun out of the trip. During the performance, Thomas and I had the great idea to take off our shirts, and then, suddenly, more and more guys began to join us. \nDay three was \"El Entierro de la Sardina,\" or the \"Burial of the Sardine.\" It was a send-off of the sardines. The send-off of the sardines is where the same groups from the parade throw a cardboard fish into a bonfire, representing the passing into Lent. Like the day before, we sat up on the school balcony to watch over and get a better view. Overall, Carnival was one of the best times for me during the trip, and I would highly recommend witnessing it if you are in the area at the time.\n\nCheck out more photos from Proctor en Segovia Winter 2024!",

They were all fighting and killing each other because they all had one common need: sins. The true meaning is mankind in sin trying to avail themselves of the earthly possessions symbolized by the hay. I would say I was close enough. On the right panel, there was a different vibe from the other two. In this panel, inhuman characters were attacking and killing humans and other inhuman characters. In the background, there was a building that I believed was a church on fire. It gave off the vibe that the world was crashing and being taken over by the devil. This panel only represented hell. Overall, the whole painting tells a story through time with the main theme of sins. The left panel was named \"Paradise,\" showing an easy and calm life. With the centerpiece being a mix of both, the family on the hay was calm, but the people surrounding them were becoming crazy. And with the final panel named \"Hell\" shows how the world crashed and humanity broke. I enjoyed reading and looking into this painting and artist because it showed me art can mean so much more than what we see from the outside. \n\n## Ryan '24 - Listening Through Seeing\n\nOnce I figured out how to navigate the maze that is the Museo del Prado, I was able to find room 49: the room with Raphael's work adorning the tall, grand walls. I recognized that I was in the right place when I saw Portrait of the Cardinal, a small piece in comparison to the others but very distinct. Upon realizing I was in the right place, I looked around for my favorite of Raphael's paintings: \"Madonna of the Rose.\" It was smaller than I pictured but even grander than I imagined. As a big fan of Michelangelo, I was able to recognize his obvious influence on Raphael's work in the form of dynamism: using gestures and activity to convey emotion. The Virgin Mary is bright with the obvious tenderness she holds for her child, dressed in a wispy blue, with pink sleeves and a subtle gold halo around her head. Baby Jesus is the most vibrant, wrapped in bold green and blue blankets. Joseph in the back is made of much darker hues. His face is shadowed as he looks down with a furrowed brow, and he is donning dark robes and is not touching Mary or either of the babies. Raphael effectively uses dynamism to reveal so much about the family dynamic through this intentional coloring, hand placements, and facial expressions.\n\n![Proctor Academy students learn about art history in Spain](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_3/v1708793864/proctoracademyorg/b7r01hucsbagbcctrd0g/MadonnaoftheRose-Raphael.jpg)\n\nAfter moving on from Madonna of the Rose, I went to view more of Raphael's work. I was simultaneously intrigued and disappointed to find that many of his works were not painted by the man himself, but rather by his students and assistants after he cultivated the outline. Originally, I assumed this meant Raphael was a selfish man who took credit for work that was not fully his, but I later learned that a large aspect of Raphael was his being a teacher. He wanted his pupils to learn, and he did this by helping them create incredible pieces of artwork that he was perfectly capable of doing himself. Due to his unexpected death at age 37, it was likely that in lieu of searching for all the students he worked with, historians simply put Raphael's name over all these paintings. \n\nOther than Raphael's work, I was also very impressed by the variation of The Last Supper, the first copy of Mona Lisa, and Miracles of the Doctors Saint Cosmas and Damien. El Prado is filled to the brim with the incredible stories that these paintings tell. I was lucky enough to spend an hour and a half of my day looking at them and listening to their stories.\n\n![Proctor Academy students study abroad in Spain](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_3/v1708793864/proctoracademyorg/plqjhgfw1psj5oie91cr/Carnaval5.jpg)\n\n## Carnaval - Owen '24\n\n### Day 2\n\nAfter coming back from a workout, I walked through the bustling streets that seemed to point towards the Plaza Mayor. I went up the cold stone steps leading up to the main street and took gulping breaths of the fresh cool air and partially cloudy skies. On top of the stairs, clustered groups of friends, lovers, and families conversed about the event taking place. I truly wasn't aware of what was happening, so with my headphones blasting music, I didn't hear the grande trumpets and drums piercing the energetic atmosphere. The more I chugged along, the more people crowded the streets, some wearing a multitude of outfits ranging from Mario to dragons. As I swerved closer, my headphones could not keep out the _Carnaval_ music. Walking then became difficult and bystanders started staring at me, confused as to why I was so adamant about missing this event. Finally, the crowds glued to the sides of buildings prevented my mission of a post-workout meal, though this was a great outcome to be fair. Rows of pink outfits filled the middle, all dancing to the upbeat melody. Like a cult, everyone bobbed in rhythm, the percussive drums reverberating through my chest. Not to mention all of the strollers, with babies that seemed to not be affected by ear-destroying levels of sound. I guess you start them young, because all ages loved every second the parade gifted to us. I passed a small band and people in reptile costumes who danced and sauntered forward to the Plaza. At this point, I felt like a true Segovian, even though, in truth, I was a random student watching the wonderful, cultural, and historic journey filled with a party through town. \n\n![Proctor Academy students learn about Spanish culture](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1708793863/proctoracademyorg/u84soozgx3xaadh08prj/Carnaval1.jpg)\n\n### Day 3\n\nThis was a night I will absolutely cherish and look back on during all of my trips to Spain. After metal art I had been sitting in the school's living room with the rest of the group, all of us awaiting the biggest day of the Carnival. Beforehand I saw a concert stage being set up in front of the cathedral, which meant for a thrilling time to experience! After a bit of conversation and theorizing about our plan, Ross and Ale came to explain how our night would go; the first being that they ordered some good pizzas to fill our stomachs and have energy for some dancing. We could already hear people gathering and speakers blaring Spanish songs through the dark town square, lit up solely by the shining street lamps, and just somehow, the excited souls of Segovia brightened it even more. A couple of us stuck with tradition and grabbed costumes, wigs, and hats, dressing for the occasion, of course, especially considering we would blend in like chorizo in a _bocadillo_. Ross soon called for a couple of pizza grabbers to help escort some pies into the impatient stomachs of our group, so Brendan and I instantly devoted ourselves to guards of some good Italian slices. We arrived at DaMario, grabbed four boxes each, and headed back out. Apparently, everyone was too preoccupied to notice I was trying to walk through because it took multiple \"pardons\" and body taps so I could get past the hypnotized mob. Once I finally entered the building and all the pizzas were laid out we went to town and devoured many boxes in an almost record time. After this cheesy dinner, we headed back down, out of the school to get the energy up and the hips swaying. As I opened the front door to find the group, I was met with a growing expansion of people, most of them having wonderful outfits. My friends were already dancing to a mini parade group with their float connected to a speaker. I joined them along with Rosa, one of our Spanish teachers, and Ale, who were just as excited and maybe even more excited than we were. The band who had been setting up this whole time started tweaking their instruments to get ready before playing, so we moved towards the front of the stage. The main singer picked up his mic and hyped up the crowd for their performance, possibly talking about giving respect to the Carnival and the people there to enjoy a wonderful show. They started with catchy and clearly popular Spanish songs, loosening up everyone and getting dances flowing. We started clapping our hands together to the beat in unison and using synchronized moves, bringing upbeat energy for hours. As time went by, my body felt fatigued, and then Ale told us to get our stuff and go home, although I wished it never ended. \n\n## Andrew '25 on Carnival\n\nCarnival is celebrated throughout the entirety of Spain. I call it the Mardi Gras of Spain. Growing up in a very New Orleans traditional house, I expected the streets of Segovia to be the next Bourbon street with all the celebrations, but that was not the case. The first official day of the Carnival began on Saturday, and it continued all through the week. On  Monday, I witnessed what was a pre-party, like a rehearsal before a big show. Seeing all the costumes and the blueprints for what was in store for the next day was cool because the Carnival was a free-for-all for the most part. Tuesday was the main event of the Carnival. On Tuesday, the streets were flooded with people from store to store. It felt like everyone from Segovia was wandering the streets in preparation for the parade. The Carnival's main attraction is the parade, composed of multiple groups of people, all complete with a float or some music. The parade began at the aqueduct. It migrated all the way up to Plaza Mayor for the official celebration.\n\nSeeing most of the parade from the school balcony was cool because you could observe everything from an aerial view instead of being elbow to elbow with what seemed like everyone within a 20-mile radius. After the parade, it surprised me; there was a cover concert right smack down in front of the cathedral, where arguably the group had the most fun out of the trip. During the performance, Thomas and I had the great idea to take off our shirts, and then, suddenly, more and more guys began to join us. \n\nDay three was \"El Entierro de la Sardina,\" or the \"Burial of the Sardine.\" It was a send-off of the sardines. The send-off of the sardines is where the same groups from the parade throw a cardboard fish into a bonfire, representing the passing into Lent. Like the day before, we sat up on the school balcony to watch over and get a better view. Overall, Carnival was one of the best times for me during the trip, and I would highly recommend witnessing it if you are in the area at the time.\n\n##   \n[Check out more photos from Proctor en Segovia Winter 2024!](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjB9Sf4)"

  "text": "In this post, Proctor en Segovia students reflect on the depth and breadth of their experiences living and learning abroad. During a typical week, Proctor students might participate in a centuries-old festival like Santa Águeda, strengthen bonds with host families entirely in Spanish, and visit one of Europe's oldest universities and immerse themselves in the rich architectural heritage of Salamanca. \nCelebration of Santa Águeda by Thomas '25\nStepping foot into a large crowd with so many different faces matched with different outfits was a lot to take in. I first noticed a man wearing a blue suit with a blue hat and thought to myself how cool that fit was. The music in the background made the scene feel as if it was straight out of a movie. I noticed that there were five or six musicians playing the flute. Everything was on beat and in rhythm. This sparked others to join in on the fun and dance. Andrew and I looked at each other and started to dance a little.\nThe ceremony was at its peak until the main event and attraction, the lighting of the \"el pelele.\" This celebration was to show that women have power. Everyone gathered around. A number of women wearing special Segovian clothes surrounded \"el pelele,\" which was about to be lit on fire. Firefighters came near the scene to help start and put out the fire. As soon as the fire was lit, these women dressed in fancy clothes started walking and dancing around the burning Pelele. This was a moment of celebration as the burning flames were flying into the crowd. The firefighters helped put the hay out as soon as it touched down on the street. The smell surrounding me was not very pleasing as many burning pieces were heading right toward who was standing in the front row. I felt I was a part of a very meaningful participation and experience, welcoming me into Spanish culture. \nPelele Celebration by Morgan '25\nNot knowing my way around Segovia, I was told to hop on the number 2 bus and get off at Santa Águeda. Being new to Segovia, I informed the bus driver where I wanted to go so she would let me know when to get off. After getting off the bus and walking a little ways away from the station, I encountered a flood of people. As I maneuvered through the crowd, trying to find a comfortable place to stand, only half a cup of beer was spilled on me and just a handful of bread crumbs fell down my shirt. As I walked through the crowd, the music was becoming clearer over all the voices.\nSomehow, I made it to the front row of the music. There were five people in total playing instruments. There were four men and one woman, and the woman stood out to me the most. She was wearing a gorgeous red and black dress with very complex detail all along the skirt and bodice area of the dress. You could tell just by how calm and in control she was that she knew exactly what she was doing. Continuing to look around, I felt very underdressed. I was wearing leggings and a short-sleeved T-shirt, while all the other women were wearing nicer skirts and jeans. I also noticed this lingering smell of sausages and cigarettes, not a very pleasant scent I will say. As I started to vibe with the music and try to dance with the locals, two women dressed as queens started to clear a large area in the center of the pavilion.\nA rope began to lower and in the blink of an eye, a fake man made out of straw dressed in a nice suit hung from the rope. I had no idea what was going on because all I knew before coming was there would be food and music. Two firemen began to pour lighter fluid on the dummy while getting the hose from the fire truck settled. Soon, a torch lit the end of the man's leg, and it began to burst into flames. More and more women began to fill the inside of the circle, all dressed the same as the one playing the instrument. These women began to dance, circling the burning dummy while it burned to ashes. Coming to this festival, it took a turn I was not expecting, but it took a turn for the better, and I am so glad I got to experience a local Segovia tradition. \nHost Family Profile: Olga by Brendan '25\nAs soon as I met Olga, I noticed that her personality was immense. When I met her for the first time, she gave me a big hug and was so excited to see me. As we made the drive from the old train station she asked me all the things that I was interested in: what I liked to eat and what I did not like to eat. As she said this to me, I felt very welcomed into my host house. The moment I was all unpacked and settled into my new room, I knew that this was going to be a great home for the next two months. She wakes up very early every morning and goes on runs before anyone else is up. I look up to her as a mentor for this. Every morning she wakes me up and gives me a big hug before I leave for school; it almost feels like she's not a host mom. When I come home from school, she always asks me questions in a way that I can comprehend. During meal times, she always makes hilarious jokes that crack everyone up. She continues her comedic side when cooking, often by doing funny dances. I will join in on these dances, and we always have a good time. She has been an amazing host, and I am so blessed to be able to stay in her house. \nHost Family Profile: Julia by Hannah '25\nJulia is my host mom. She was the first person I met when I arrived in Spain, and she's the one who I come home to for a freshly cooked meal. She's the one who doesn't speak any English but has the patience to help me learn and understand more. Before coming to Spain, I knew very little about her; however, even after the first week, she was my favorite person ever. Julia is a very calm and happy person. She lives by herself and has the most amazing daughter and grandchildren who come and have lunch with us every Tuesday. She lives a very simple life, but she's so happy. I come home and she is always smiling. She has short brown hair, always tied up into a half ponytail. She loves sewing and knitting. Her favorite shows are Wheel of Fortune and Pasa Palabra. She loves oranges, and after I told her I love oranges too, I came home to a huge pile of them on the kitchen counter. She is a big reason why this trip has been so incredible.\nHost Family Profile: Angela by Reese '25\nComing to Spain, I was scared to meet my host family. However, I have been very comfortable since my first interaction with my host mother Angela. Angela is very sweet and showed me everything she thought I would need while living with them, such as where the towels are or how to use the shower. She always tells me that I can help myself to anything and that it is my house as much as it is their house. Angela is often cold when she is at home, so she always wears her fuzzy blue robe. She is also much shorter than me so when I am having a conversation with her or helping bring food to the table, the height difference becomes notable. I find it funny when I notice it. She always asks me about my day and gets excited to show me all of the new metalwork she has been doing. I have loved living with her so far and she has been so welcoming. \nHost Family Profile: Maruja by Ryan '24\nLiving in someone else's home is certainly not easy. It is hard to adjust to the fact that you're constantly in someone else's space. Living with Maruja, though, has been wonderful. She is endlessly kind and welcoming. She is a sweet grandmother, so she's always fussing over me for something. I will tell her about a test I'm not looking forward to taking, and a week later she asks me about it. She always remembers, she always shows me such kindness. I respect all the host families for choosing to host a student in their house for the majority of the year, but I respect Maruja even more after living with her. She is a beautiful soul that I am privileged to know.\nProgram director Alejandra with host mother Maruja.\nCathedrals Here, There and Everywhere by Owen W. '24\nI woke up this morning around 9:00 am. We set off to leave around 10:15, so I was very happy to have a sleep-in. I grabbed a bag of food my host mother Conchi made the night before and took the elevator down to go outside. The sky was filled with sun and the air was fresh. After my calming walk, I arrived at the bus station along with the group who I saw waiting for the bus to take us to the train station. The ride to the train station was smooth, and after a quick walk through security plus some waiting, we entered the highly comfortable seats and took off. \nWe arrived in Salamanca and walked up to the Plaza Mayor. There, Ross and Ale explained our plan for the whole day. Second only to Madrid, Salamanca's gold-colored stone and rows of balconies showcased this grand town square. Soon after, we came across the Convent of San Esteban, a huge monastery with wonderful architectural designs, especially on the front. Reese did her History presentation there while storks clapped their beaks at us from on top of the building (quite scary!). When the Dominican Order arrived in 1255, an earlier convent had been made before its destruction for the now newer one. Our eyes feasted on the baroque, final gothic, and plateresque styles. \nI started along the stairs leading down to a main street, where I saw the Roman wall and bridge they used for protection in battles and travel during their rule. We also came across a familiar statue of Lazaro de Tormes and the blind man, right next to the Tormes river itself. We read the novel Lazarillo de Tormes, which was set in Salamanca and Toledo. Next to it was also a headless statue of possibly a pig. Hannah explained how it was an important and old monument accidentally thrown into the river before the Romans had to bring it back to the surface. On the Roman bridge, Thomas presented the importance it had connecting provinces and the battles fought near it. We walked up a breathtaking walkway (yes it was steep, not pretty) that led to the cluster of historical buildings, which included the new and old Catedral plus the university. The facades of these buildings were intricate with many figures carved with the intention to tell eligious stories from the Bible through art. I loved the overwhelming intricacies in the facade of the new cathedral wall, showing Jesus's crucifixion along with many other stories and monsters peeking out of crevasses, perfectly separated by overlapping stone embroidery. I presented on the old cathedral, which was commissioned by a bishop for a Saint. We also checked out the huge and beautiful university, which holds many international students around the globe. The group then split up for an hour or so before coming back to the train station and heading home after a certainly visually and mentally interesting day! \nCheck out more photos from Proctor en Segovia Winter 2024!",

She loves oranges, and after I told her I love oranges too, I came home to a huge pile of them on the kitchen counter. She is a big reason why this trip has been so incredible.\n\n## **Host Family Profile: Angela by Reese '25**\n\nComing to Spain, I was scared to meet my host family. However, I have been very comfortable since my first interaction with my host mother Angela. Angela is very sweet and showed me everything she thought I would need while living with them, such as where the towels are or how to use the shower. She always tells me that I can help myself to anything and that it is my house as much as it is their house. Angela is often cold when she is at home, so she always wears her fuzzy blue robe. She is also much shorter than me so when I am having a conversation with her or helping bring food to the table, the height difference becomes notable. I find it funny when I notice it. She always asks me about my day and gets excited to show me all of the new metalwork she has been doing. I have loved living with her so far and she has been so welcoming. \n\n## **Host Family Profile: Maruja by Ryan '24**\n\nLiving in someone else's home is certainly not easy. It is hard to adjust to the fact that you're constantly in someone else's space. Living with Maruja, though, has been wonderful. She is endlessly kind and welcoming. She is a sweet grandmother, so she's always fussing over me for something. I will tell her about a test I'm not looking forward to taking, and a week later she asks me about it. She always remembers, she always shows me such kindness. I respect all the host families for choosing to host a student in their house for the majority of the year, but I respect Maruja even more after living with her. She is a beautiful soul that I am privileged to know.\n\nProgram director Alejandra with host mother Maruja.\n\n## **Cathedrals Here, There and Everywhere by Owen W. '24**\n\nI woke up this morning around 9:00 am. We set off to leave around 10:15, so I was very happy to have a sleep-in. I grabbed a bag of food my host mother Conchi made the night before and took the elevator down to go outside. The sky was filled with sun and the air was fresh. After my calming walk, I arrived at the bus station along with the group who I saw waiting for the bus to take us to the train station. The ride to the train station was smooth, and after a quick walk through security plus some waiting, we entered the highly comfortable seats and took off. \n\nWe arrived in Salamanca and walked up to the Plaza Mayor. There, Ross and Ale explained our plan for the whole day. Second only to Madrid, Salamanca's gold-colored stone and rows of balconies showcased this grand town square. Soon after, we came across the Convent of San Esteban, a huge monastery with wonderful architectural designs, especially on the front. Reese did her History presentation there while storks clapped their beaks at us from on top of the building (quite scary!). When the Dominican Order arrived in 1255, an earlier convent had been made before its destruction for the now newer one. Our eyes feasted on the baroque, final gothic, and plateresque styles. \n\nI started along the stairs leading down to a main street, where I saw the Roman wall and bridge they used for protection in battles and travel during their rule. We also came across a familiar statue of Lazaro de Tormes and the blind man, right next to the Tormes river itself. We read the novel _Lazarillo de Tormes_, which was set in Salamanca and Toledo. Next to it was also a headless statue of possibly a pig. Hannah explained how it was an important and old monument accidentally thrown into the river before the Romans had to bring it back to the surface. On the Roman bridge, Thomas presented the importance it had connecting provinces and the battles fought near it. We walked up a breathtaking walkway (yes it was steep, not pretty) that led to the cluster of historical buildings, which included the new and old _Catedral_ plus the university. The facades of these buildings were intricate with many figures carved with the intention to tell eligious stories from the Bible through art. I loved the overwhelming intricacies in the facade of the new cathedral wall, showing Jesus's crucifixion along with many other stories and monsters peeking out of crevasses, perfectly separated by overlapping stone embroidery. I presented on the old cathedral, which was commissioned by a bishop for a Saint. We also checked out the huge and beautiful university, which holds many international students around the globe. The group then split up for an hour or so before coming back to the train station and heading home after a certainly visually and mentally interesting day!     \n\n## [Check out more photos from Proctor en Segovia Winter 2024!](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjB9Sf4)"

  "text": "Morgan '25\nBelieve it or not, this week was our first FULL week of school - classes from Monday - to Friday with afternoon activities each day and no changes in the schedule. This being said, we can finally say we are getting into the grove of living in Spain! I would say this week marks the week when things start to feel normal. My host family has taken me in as their second daughter. We know the streets of Segovia like we have lived here for years, and obviously, we have scouted out our favorite restaurants for Friday and Saturday night dinners. This week we had a special guest, Karine Dumont. She came to visit us on Wednesday and left on Saturday. She joined us for classes and afternoon activities throughout the week, and it was so great getting to see her during the program. She chose the perfect week because the weather was in the mid 60's which I would say is perfect! \nOn Saturday morning, we got a little sleep in, which is always nice, and at 11:30, we made our way to the Alcázar De Segovia, which is this palace turned into a museum. This took us back to our very first day, when we walked over and looked at it from the outside, but on Saturday, we got to go inside and look around. Though it was a busy Saturday morning, we made our way through the large group tours and gave ourselves our own tour! There was art hanging from every wall and all the ceilings were plated with engraved gold; it was stunning! We made our way up to the top of the palace, and as Hannah counted, 170 stairs later, we got to see the whole city of Segovia from a perspective we had never seen before. Looking straight on, you can see a whole city, but turn your head to the left just a little and you see all grassland and mountains. Later on Saturday, we had our free time, but we all knew we needed to rest up for our long and exciting Sunday. \nOn Sunday we met at the bus station at 1:45 pm to depart from Segovia and to take on our travels to Madrid. After some confusion with the buses and train hopping, we finally arrived in Madrid at our hotel at around 6:00 - we did stop along the way to do some shopping, of course! As we rushed to change into our red, white, and blue to support Atlético de Madrid, we hurried out of the hotel to hop on the Metro and head to the stadium. \nProctor en Segovia students participate in a different activity every afternoon.\nWe were about an hour early, so we knew we would not miss anything (not even the warmups), but we still had to sprint to keep up with Thomas and Ethan. I would say they were just a tad excited! As we hiked up what felt like hundreds of stairs to get to our seats, we made it and took in the view of the Atlético de Madrid home stadium. Listening to all the Spanish cheers going back and forth between the Madrid and the Valencia fan sections was so fun. Brendan and Andrew were trying to join in, but I don't think even Spaniards could even understand what was coming out of their mouths. The game began, and in the last minute of stoppage time in the first half, Atlético drilled one into the back of the net, and when I tell you, the WHOLE stadium went crazy. It was unlike any American sports game I had been to before. The boys ripped their shirts off and swung them in the air along with their scarves to contribute to the celebration. Later in the second half, Atlético scored once again to make the final score 2-0! We all made it back to the hotel safely, and Hannah, Reese, and I got our Atlético de Madrid scarves to take home as souvenirs. The game was a whole new experience that I will never forget and it was awesome to see this kind of Spanish culture. I will also never forget the 30-minute-long conversation I had with my 12-year-old host brother debriefing the entire game on Monday during siesta, but that is another story. \nEthan '25\nThis week was the first week we had classes every day. I am now getting into a pattern with my schedule. The host family is nice, and I have watched a few soccer games with my host dad. It took the group some time, but we finally found good places to eat out. This week felt like it took forever to end because I was so excited about our trip over the weekend. I have always wanted to attend a European soccer game since I started playing soccer. We traveled to Madrid to watch the soccer match between Atlético de Madrid and Valencia CF. \nWe had to take the Metro from our hotel to get to the stadium, and all you could see on the train was red, white, and blue. The train was filled with Athletico Madrid fans. When walking to the stadium, there were thousands of people and it was like nothing I have ever seen. As soon as we took our seats, I could tell that this was going to be a good game because of how the fans were acting. The seats we had were high up, but you could see the whole field, see when players were about to make a run, and see who a player might pass to. The first goal was scored in the 45th minute and the stadium went crazy. The lights in the stadium started flashing and the fans started chanting. The second goal was in the 57th minute and the same thing happened. The game was very lopsided with Athletico Madrid dominating the whole game. I enjoyed this trip very much because one of my dreams had come true. I will always remember this experience: the chants, the music, and the whole atmosphere in the stadium. \nThomas '25\nThe trip to Madrid to watch the fútbol game between Atletico de Madrid and Valencia was all that I could have hoped for. From the second we got on the Metro until our arrival at the stadium, it was full-blown chaos. Being trapped in the Metro surrounded by people was like being inside a small cave. Moments after stepping outside of the Metro station, I noticed a big wall and I had no clue what was behind it. There were many people walking around it, so I followed in their footsteps. To my surprise, I soon saw the biggest stadium I had ever seen. The stadium was filled with a rich red color that you could see from miles away. \nI was filled with joy and excitement as we scanned our tickets and started running up the big stairs that felt like a gateway to heaven. I could hear the noises coming from the inside and they got louder and louder as we came closer to our seats. I will never forget that first glance at what was one of the coolest scenes I have ever seen. The pitch was so perfect. The lines on the field were stunning, and the sprinklers were going off to make the pitch even nicer. One player in particular that I was very excited to watch live in person was forward from Atletico Madrid, #7 Antoine Griezmann. Ever since the 2018 World Cup, he has been one of my favorite players to watch; it is not only his goal-scoring ability that makes him so good but also his goal celebrations. \nWhen the players took the field for warmups, the stadium got electric. From that moment I knew this was going to be something to remember. The starting whistle had sounded and the game had begun. The noise and energy in the stadium once that whistle blew to kick things off was straight out of a movie. The supporting section of Atletico was jumping up and down, chanting for the full 90+ minutes; at times, you could feel under your feet shaking because of how hype everyone was getting. Almost half of the game had passed without a score. Eventually, #12 Samuel Lino received a well-placed ball over the top and, with a great first touch, placed it between the keeper's legs and into the back of the net to take a 1-0 lead as the stadium roared with excitement that even I could barely hear the people surrounding me. After the goal, the energy had shifted completely to a whole new level. With the lead standing at 1-0 minutes after the second half began, the crowd kept chanting \"Atleti, Atleti, Atleti,\" for which they are famous. Then comes a ball on the near side driven in and headed into the back of the net to make it 2-0 in favor of Atlético. Once again, we could feel the vibration and eruption from the top of the stadium.\nAs the referee blew the final whistle, the fans stood up to clap and cheer for Atlético as they had just won, securing themselves a 3rd place standing after the result. The rush to get out of a stadium was no joke as there were thousands upon thousands of people racing to get out to beat the traffic. We left the stadium, and I took my last few looks at what was one of the coolest and most exciting events I've ever been a part of.\nCheck out more photos from Proctor en Segovia Winter 2024!",

  "text": "Ryan '24 - My Ramble through Spain\nLike the author of \"A Ramble Through Barcelona,\" I too was able to visit the magnificent La Pedrera, or Antonio Gaudi's 1910 apartment building. I am mostly unfamiliar with Gaudi's work, but what better way to get a feel for it than to view the very home he designed for himself? When I saw La Pedrera, my initial reaction was simply: wow!\nGaudí's La Sagrada Familia\nOur trip to Barcelona included a lot of walking, and the walk to arrive in front of La Pedrera was no exception. Tired, thirsty, and slightly attitudinal, I stood before this masterpiece and simply took it in. The amazing splashes of color, almost floral-like, that decorate the exterior, the vibrant green shutters, and unconventionally shaped balconies left me mesmerized. I am not usually so wowed by architecture, but Gaudi is anything but usual. Though we had the privilege of visiting a myriad of beautiful and exciting places throughout our excursion, La Pedrera was most definitely a highlight. \nWhile I have been in Spain, I have certainly been put to the test. My Spanish speaking skills went from something I occasionally practiced on Duolingo to a necessity for basic communication. My host mother, sweet Maruja, does not speak a word of English. That being said, I've had to step it up to be able to communicate with her. And step it up I have - Maruja and I have some great conversations at the dinner table. She is muy ‘graciosa,' very funny. Her house is located a 20-minute walk from the school, which was rather inconvenient until I discovered the bus! It took some trial and error before I figured it out, (more than I would enjoy admitting), but now I've got it down. The bus stop is only a 2-minute walk from Maruja's, which is excellent because now I can wear my heeled boots and lace-up loafers. Hannah, Ethan, and I live close, and we take the bus to school together every morning.\nLujan leads a cooking master class during the weekly Thursday night cooking activity.\nSegovia is as beautiful as all the previous students have described. Living abroad as a high school student is a privilege I do not take for granted. My time here has been nothing but beautiful. I even celebrated my 18th birthday at our group's current obsession: Il Tempietto. For any future students who come here and love Caesar salad, I highly recommend it. \nAndrew '25 - Gaudí's Barcelona\nOur first trip of the term was to Barcelona on a four-day excursion. We had the great opportunity to visit several of Gaudí's amazing architectural works and take in all of what he had to offer. Our main objective was to visit La Sagrada Familia, the church that has been being built for over 100 years. Before we got there, we got to see another piece of work by Gaudí.\nRoss gives Proctor en Segovia students a primer in Valencian history.\nHis other piece is an apartment building that has no sharp edges. Everywhere a corner could be was replaced with a smooth wrap-around and curving architecture that contrasted with no other building on the block. This apartment building was so unique that it made a whole tour group stop to take pictures. After that short pit stop, we started to walk to La Sagrada Familia, and the moment we arrived, the surroundings and atmosphere felt quiet but also so loud at the same time. La Sagrada itself was breathtaking; a mix of modern and very old wings clashed together to create this Cathedral. The droopiness and the off-centered art contrasted with the modern look that appeared to be taking over with the holy sight. I loved getting to see the La Sagrada, and it reminded me of the Block in Saudia Arabia because of how breathtaking and important it is for many cultures. \nThe view from Gaudí's Parc Guell\nReese '25 - Barcelona and Valencia\nOur trip to Barcelona and Valencia was an incredible experience whether we were walking around Barcelona to find all of Antonio Gaudí famous architecture or trying Spanish delicacies at the Plaza de la Reina in Valencia, like the drink horchata or churros. Many of us were pushed to leave our comfort zone. Taking trains, buses, metros, or walking, the group had to adjust to be more aware of our surroundings. Thomas was on high alert for pickpockets no matter where we were. Hannah took her first high-speed train and saw the Mediterranean for the first time. So it's fair to say her trip was a success!\nSampling churros in Valencia\nWe went to the Barcelona FC museum, and although I am not a huge soccer fan, the Museum was remarkable. We spent the rest of the day walking around Barcelona, we went to a famous park called Parc Guell. After the park, we walked a long way to see the ocean. Everyone was very tired after a long day of walking, but seeing the ocean was wonderful. Since all our activities in Barcelona wore us out, we had a relaxing night to prepare for our trip to Valencia the next morning. \nThe trip to Valencia was not long. We were excited to be in Valencia until we stepped outside to unfortunately see it was pouring rain. We walked around Valencia when we got there the first day, but the main event in Valencia was the aquarium. The aquarium in Valencia was so much fun for Morgan and me that we spent hours looking at everything and running around trying to find our favorite animals. Morgan was enamored by the sea turtles and the seahorses. I was so excited that I got to see the sharks and stingrays. Although Morgan and I thought seeing these incredible animals was awesome, the dolphin show was spectacular. Spending so much time so close to one another with little alone time meant that we faced things together, like when the girls lost one of our room keys in Barcelona, and all the girls did a room hunt to find it(which sadly was unsuccessful). Lastly, our trip was also successful as it helped bring the group together and create bonds and lasting memories.\nCheck out more photos from Proctor en Segovia Winter 2024!",

  "text": "My First Days in Spain - Owen W. '24\nMy first days in Spain were very stressful, but I know I have to learn how to live in Segovia. Our group landed in Madrid's airport where Ale and Ross picked us up. Then, we drove an hour to the city of Segovia. The second I arrived, I felt happy because I wanted a place that didn't have many problems so I could relax and enjoy the experience more. \nWhen I first met my host family I realized that we didn't know many words in either language. This is good because now my Spanish is being challenged and will get better every day I spend in Spain. My new house is perfect; the two host brothers who live with Conchi and Roberto are nice. I have also been able to explore the city and walk by the 2000-year-old Roman aqueduct.\nThe next day, after a good night's sleep, I was still jet lagged, and it was hard to understand or focus on the plan for the day and the structure of the program. I am eager to adjust to Segovian life and to the school schedule. I am also looking forward to exploring the city's restaurants and eating at delicious restaurants. Segovia is flanked by a range of beautiful large mountains covered in snow. At night Segovia is alive and there are many Spaniards and/or tourists walking around the Plaza de Mayor; this makes me feel happy and very excited. Eating Spanish hot chocolate for the first time was perfect! Conchi and Roberto, my host parents, also make amazing food.\nThis first week was fun and interesting but, at the same time, overwhelming. Spain is a great country with many new things to learn about. Hence, it has been challenging in may ways: sleep, food, new schedule, jet lag, new house/family, and others. Needless to say, I have sometimes felt overwhelmed and scared of many new things, such as not being able to adjust and function well here in Spain.\nMattie '24\nMy first day in Spain was very tiring. After driving 3 hours to Boston Logan, the group caught our flight to Madrid. Time change and jet lag is very hard to deal with. One out of the 10 of us was able to sleep on the plane, so we all landed pretty exhausted. When we landed, Ross and Ale picked us up and drove us to Segovia, only 1 hour north of Madrid. Once we arrived in Segovia, our host families picked us up and took us to our new house. My host mom is Lujan, who is also our cooking teacher! I had a rocky start in the beginning because there was a complication with her house, so I had to move into Resse's host family for a day or two. I was able to move back in with Lujan by the middle to end of our first week! Lujan is the best host mom you could ever have in Spain. She has a dog named Fito, and he is the cutest. We take him on evening walks together around a park near her house, and she lets me help her cook meals, which I was very surprised about because I was told Spanish mothers are very protective of their kitchens. \nThe school is a good 15-20 minute walk from my house, so it's not too bad! I live near Andrew, Thomas, and Brendan, so we walk home a lot together! At school, we have three classes a day. We start at 9:25 and start with English class with Ale or History class with Ross. Then we have Spanish class with either Maria Jose or Rosa for three hours with many little breaks so we keep our energy and focus! I am in María José ’s class with Thomas, Brendan and Andrew! It is such a fun class! María José is the best Spanish teacher ever. She makes class so fun and involved! She is a very non-traditional teacher in the way she teaches and what she teaches, and in our class, we are responding very well to this different way of teaching! We ended the day with either History class or English class. After that, we are free to go at 1:45 pm and have comida and siesta at 2:00 with our host family. Then, around 4:30 to 5, we have a different activity in the afternoon. It could be cooking class, metalworking, painting, ceramics, yoga, pilates, or going to the gym. Everyone in this particular group joined gym 47 because they have had the longest relationship with the Proctor community, and we have built such a good working relationship that even on Sundays when the gym is closed, we have our own key! They have classes for us, like yoga and dance classes. They also have a sauna that hits so hard some days! \nMetalworking with Jesus is unbelievable; he is such a fun person to learn and hang out with. He blasts fun music and gives us candy, which is a Proctor kid's weakness! For example, can you imagine your grandpa dancing to Drake and Bad Bunny with you?? Probably not! After spending an hour or two in your afternoon activity, you sometimes have evening class, meeting, or free time until 9:00, when you head back home for 'cena' and bonding time with your host family. Lujan likes to watch game shows and a Spanish Too Hot to Handle or Love Island, so we get to gossip about these shows (or I attempt to)! \nIt is a very different schedule and culture here in Spain, so one of my main struggles is finding the right time to do homework and sleep. Jet lag has been my weakness. I haven't found a good sleep schedule yet, so it has thrown everything through a loop. Hopefully, this next week, I can get a better schedule going. This is an amazing group! We all hang out, go out in the town, meet locals, and give each other ideas and advice on overcoming some of our first-week challenges. As someone who has participated in three off-campus programs, this is probably the group that has become the closest in only one week in. We all are just having a blast through our ups and downs and are sticking together through it all! \nIf you are an underclassman and are reading this, come to Spain! It is such an amazing experience, and I am saying this only one week in! Just do it!\nAndrew '25\nArriving in Madrid on Sunday marked a huge milestone for these coming weeks. A realization was beginning to set in that I would be in a completely different country for the next eight weeks. Curiosity took over my mind as I was thinking about who would be my host family and do they even speak English? To answer the question, they do not speak English. After meeting Ana and José Luis at the station, we went to their house. The ride over was quiet because I started to think about how I had never talked to these people before, and now I'm going to live with them for eight weeks.\nAfter settling down, we walked to the school. As we were getting settled down, the first two days were extremely hard and tiring due to the jet lag the whole group was experiencing. After quite a bit of trial and error, it finally seems like we are getting the hang of it in Segovia. Getting adjusted to the classes was a bit of a challenge, but it changed over time. Last Saturday, we took a trip to La Granja, beyond Nueva Segovia. There we got to tour a royal palace and look at art that showed us how the elite lived in the 1700s and 1800s.\nCheck out more photos from Proctor en Segovia Winter 2024!",

As we were getting settled down, the first two days were extremely hard and tiring due to the jet lag the whole group was experiencing. After quite a bit of trial and error, it finally seems like we are getting the hang of it in Segovia. Getting adjusted to the classes was a bit of a challenge, but it changed over time. Last Saturday, we took a trip to La Granja, beyond Nueva Segovia. There we got to tour a royal palace and look at art that showed us how the elite lived in the 1700s and 1800s.\n\n[Check out more photos from Proctor en Segovia Winter 2024!](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjB9Sf4)"

From living with a host family, to studying Spanish and rainforest ecology, to being fully immersed in Costa Rican culture, Morgan ‘25, Reese ‘25, Will ‘25, Bella ‘25, Henry ‘25, and Emma ‘25 have experienced a life-changing term abroad. \nMorgan ‘25 \nAfter a full week of school and activities, Kathia wanted to surprise us with a new activity for the program that we would be the first to experience. She told us that we would be going bat netting on Friday night at the Monteverde Reserve. When we got there we met up with a few of our teachers and our guide, Vino. Vino showed us all the nets and how the researchers at the reserve catch bats. We made our way through the nets to an area where Vino showed us all the different types of bats and told us a little bit about each of them. \nSaturday, we did not have an activity planned, so we all got some extra time with our host families. For these last three weeks, we have all been trying to spend as much time with our families as possible because the time will go by faster than we expect. \nThis weekend we also spent a lot of time around the center of Monteverde trying new restaurants. This Saturday the girls and I went to a new place for brunch called The Tree House Café, which is a restaurant that is built around a tree. On Sunday, we all spent the mornings out with our families. I went to my host cousin's 6th birthday party and met some extended family of theirs. Spending time with my extended host family makes me realize how many connections there are in this small community. After lunch, we all met up and went to the town center to do some shopping for the Super Bowl. We went to Bella's house and had a small Super Bowl party with her host family which was a great way to end an amazing week. \nReese ‘25 \nThis past week was full of fun activities and adventures like learning a new Latin dance and racing each other on our horses. On Friday we had a Spanish class in town; we were only allowed to talk to locals in Spanish and had many tasks to accomplish, such as getting directions to the bank, purchasing a fruit we had never eaten before, and asking someone to take a picture of us in front of the church.\nWhen we finished we had a big lunch of only typical Costa Rica foods with our Spanish teacher Eva. Later Friday afternoon Ernest brought us to a local hotel called Selina’s where we went in the hot tubs and got dinner. There was a DJ so we stayed, danced and played pool. \nOn Saturday we went on a coffee tour with our science teacher Beto. We learned a lot about how coffee and chocolate are made and we also got to try the chocolate and the coffee beans. We were all surprised that chocolate comes from seeds inside the large fruit of the cacao plant. On Saturday all of the girls spent the night at Bella's house, making popcorn and spending time with Bella's host sister Wanda and host mom Maribel. We have had a lot of fun so far, but we are getting sad that our time in Costa Rica is almost coming to an end!",

Over the past two weeks, students have continued their academic courses while immersing themselves in the biodiversity of the Children’s Eternal Rainforest. \nHenry ‘25\nLast weekend we took a three day trip to San Gerardo Field Station. The station is very remote, situated deep into the Childrens’ Eternal Rainforest, Costa Rica’s largest private reserve, purchased by school kids in the 1980s to protect this area of biodiversity from deforestation. \nOur experiences there were amazing to say the least. Throughout the whole trip there was no phone service, making the time we spent together all the more meaningful. The trip began with a hike deep down into the forest with Mark, our incredibly knowledgeable guide for the weekend. After stopping many times to observe the flora and fauna, we made it, sopping wet, to the Field Station. We warmed up and were presented with an amazing array of hot food. Later in the afternoon we had the opportunity to relax in hammocks on the porch before beginning a night hike back into the forest to experience nocturnal wildlife. \nSaturday was filled with wonderful adventures, documenting all of the amazing things that we saw. We also had the unique experience of spending an hour or so alone in the forest. As we hiked out the next morning the sun began to shine, revealing incredible views of Volcano Arenal nearby. This trip was an incredible way to understand the rainforest around us better.\nBrenden ‘25\nIn Monteverde, we have had many experiences of being immersed in nature or working hands-on with animals. Saturday we went on a trip to Kathia's farm. This trip brought new experiences for all of us. We had many opportunities to learn at the farm such as brushing, saddling and riding horses, milking cows, and feeding the calves from bottles. Working a farm takes enormous effort; for example, Kathia's husband Celimo has to tend to the horses and cows, cut and shred the grass to feed them, and constantly fix things around the property. Everything on the farm was hand-built by Celimo himself, which makes it all seem more amazing. Seeing how everything works on the farm makes you appreciate the dedication that it takes to maintain it.\nRight after the farm we visited a butterfly garden. We began with a presentation where they showed many different insects like scorpions and stick bugs. We learned that stick bugs have made many adaptations, such as disconnecting one of their limbs if they are being attacked. Afterward we explored many large enclosed habitats, each one being made to suit a different climate and altitude, filled with different plants and butterflies that were specific to that region. We learned that butterflies also have many adaptations to survive in the wild, such as having colorations that look similar to other butterflies that are poisonous, thereby discouraging predators. The whole group really enjoyed seeing the different species of butterflies and learning about their adaptations.",

We also had the unique experience of spending an hour or so alone in the forest. As we hiked out the next morning the sun began to shine, revealing incredible views of Volcano Arenal nearby. This trip was an incredible way to understand the rainforest around us better.\n\n![Proctor in Costa Rica Study Abroad](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1678636318/proctoracademyorg/icoi32laiaw6nkaxcsjj/Costa22.jpg)\n\n## Brenden ‘25\n\nIn Monteverde, we have had many experiences of being immersed in nature or working hands-on with animals. Saturday we went on a trip to Kathia's farm. This trip brought new experiences for all of us. We had many opportunities to learn at the farm such as brushing, saddling and riding horses, milking cows, and feeding the calves from bottles. Working a farm takes enormous effort; for example, Kathia's husband Celimo has to tend to the horses and cows, cut and shred the grass to feed them, and constantly fix things around the property. Everything on the farm was hand-built by Celimo himself, which makes it all seem more amazing. Seeing how everything works on the farm makes you appreciate the dedication that it takes to maintain it.\n\nRight after the farm we visited a butterfly garden. We began with a presentation where they showed many different insects like scorpions and stick bugs. We learned that stick bugs have made many adaptations, such as disconnecting one of their limbs if they are being attacked. Afterward we explored many large enclosed habitats, each one being made to suit a different climate and altitude, filled with different plants and butterflies that were specific to that region. We learned that butterflies also have many adaptations to survive in the wild, such as having colorations that look similar to other butterflies that are poisonous, thereby discouraging predators. The whole group really enjoyed seeing the different species of butterflies and learning about their adaptations. \n\n![Proctor in Costa Rica Study Abroad](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1678636337/proctoracademyorg/slw5j3thci4osswjaoc4/Costa23.jpg)"

As Nicola ‘26 and Magnus ‘26 reflect on their time studying abroad and living with host families in Costa Rica, they share insights into the very heart of the Proctor experience: independence, the stretching of comfort zones, and pursuit of passions. Read more in this final blog from Proctor en Monteverde. \nNicola ‘26\nFor me, deciding to be a part of Proctor Academy Monteverde experience has been about being outside my comfort zone while learning to become more independent. One example of this for me would be the use of Spanish and how much it is used in my daily life here. The program heavily emphasizes using Spanish, which I loved, but put me outside of my comfort zone. If you told a younger freshman me when I first arrived at Proctor that I would have the opportunity to go to Costa Rica in my sophomore year I wouldn't believe you at all. When I first got the news that I had been accepted into the program I was excited but didn't know much about what would actually happen and what it would even be like. The only thing I could be sure about was that I would be doing something completely new and would have to be ready for anything. Our first week in Costa Rica was a blur, the group stayed for three days at a hotel a five-minute walk from the beach. It was the perfect place to get situated with the program and have the baseline for the next 8 weeks laid out in front of us. After our orientation at the beach, we were finally in Monteverde. \nOne of the biggest pieces of independence about the entire trip was limited access to our phones. The hardest thing about not having phones was the lack of communication. It was hard to know where you were in the town at times without a phone. I would also say that being without my phone has pushed me outside of my comfort zone as well and I have never been without it for this amount of time. The thing that I would say pushed me the farthest was the trip to San Gerardo, a two-day trip into the Children's Eternal Rainforest. These two days were the highlight of the trip without a doubt, but they also put me the farthest out of my comfort zone. I had never experienced a forest like the Children's Eternal Rainforest. Along with the beauty and mystery of the forest, there is the story of how it began. Now I won't spoil the story for you but all I will say is that the trip to San Gerardo was genuinely life-changing and I am so happy I had the opportunity to go. Without this program, I would not have had the opportunity to have experiences like this.\nMagnus ‘26\nWe started the term at a beachside hotel for an orientation for the first three days. After we finished the orientation we made the nearly three-hour trip up the mountain to Monteverde. I remember sitting in the car after the first person got dropped off at their homestay and just having this wave of nervousness hit me. I had just realized that I would be meeting the people that I would be living with for the next ten weeks. We got to my stop and I saw my host family waiting outside with huge smiles on their faces and I realized that I would be in good hands for the time to come. Once I got inside there was a delicious lunch of arroz con pollo already prepared and my little brother was ecstatic once we finished eating to go play soccer. \nAs time passed I learned about the town of Monteverde, like where the best bakery in town is which has become a nearly daily visit. I also learned how beautiful this tiny secluded mountain village is and how close the community is. I have met so many new locals who have treated me with nothing but kindness and have made me feel like a part of the community. For example, I have met many people who are related to my host family and they have been very nice, like when my host sister's husband who is a personal trainer saw me in the gym and came up to me and gave me tips on how to correct my form on exercises. \nPersonally, there have been some difficult parts of this term. But in the end, I think that these difficult parts are what has made the trip so special. At the end of a trip like this, the difficult things are what are going to stick with me forever. One thing that has been particularly hard for me has been homesickness. I thought that since I went to boarding school I wouldn't get homesick after so much time, however, it was very hard not to see or talk to my friends and family for such extended periods. This was multiplied by the fact I didn't have my phone all week so my main source of contact wasn't there. This struggle reminds me of when I was on my Wilderness Orientation in which there was a fair amount of complaining, but to this day I still reflect on the hard times with the friend I made on the trip and the experience. I believe that this term abroad will have that same effect on me and truly alter my view on how I see everyday life. \nPerhaps the part that exemplifies this the most was my camping trip last weekend. It was a 3-day trip in which we hiked to a station that we slept at. We were accompanied by a man named Mark Wainwright who was one of the most knowledgeable people I have ever met. There were many parts of this trip that I was left to be alone with my thoughts. Most notably at the end of one of our hikes we had this exercise where we had to walk back alone for an hour and just observe and think. That activity really displayed my outlook on the rest of this trip. I don't have to love it or hate it or be entertained, I just have to keep going and observe. \nLearn more about Proctor en Monteverde here!",

Read more from Lulu ‘26 and Sophie ‘26 share reflections from life in Monteverde this week. \nLulu ‘26 \nOne Thursday for our science class, we went bat catching. When I first heard we were doing this activity I was very confused. Before going I thought of bats as creepy animals that are blind, live in caves, only come out at night, and don't have a huge impact on anything. Once we got to the bat jungle, a small plot of forest, and met Beno, I realized how wrong I was about bats. \nBeno is a bat specialist; he knows everything there is to know about bats. At the bat jungle, they set up nets hanging from tree to tree just before sunset. Once the sun sets, bats start to fly into the nets, which is how we catch them. Once they are in the nets Beno and his coworkers put them in little pouches. Once he takes them out of the pouch we let them go. We saw eight different species of bats. We all stood in a circle around Beno as he told us all about bats. We learned that bats are not blind they can see better than humans, they can fly faster than a cheetah can run, and they have a 6th sense. This 6th sense is echolocation. The coolest part was we got to hold the bats. Don’t judge, they are really cute, the ones that didn't bite of course. We didn't hold the ones that still bite. Surprisingly they are very soft. Their hearts beat 400 times a minute, making my hand shake while holding it. Surprisingly I wasn’t scared to hold the bat. \nWe learned that there are 1,400 species of bats. One is a vampire and that’s exactly how it sounds. There are fruit-eating bats, flower-eating bats, meat-eating bats, and insect-eating bats. Before I didn't think bats played an important role in anything. After I learned that without bats it would mess up the food chain. Some insects would overpopulate and flowers and fruits wouldn't have the bats to disperse their seeds. This may come across as boring to some people but it was fascinating and fun to learn about. \nSophie ‘26 \nOne weekend my host mom Cynthia said that we were going to the beach! I put my bathing suit on, grabbed some sunscreen, and got in the car. The beach was called Playa Blanca and was about two hours away. The drive to the beach was beautiful, we passed mountains and mango trees. When we got to the beach I ran right into the water, where I spent most of my time that day along with my host brothers Mattias and Dario. We swam and played games for a while until we got tired. \nWe stayed until the sun began to go down and then packed up our things to start on the long drive back. We had barely made it out of the parking lot when Cynthia stopped the car and got out to check something. She began talking to people around her and the only word that I could understand was ‘mechanic’. It wasn’t until I had to get out of the car and help them push it down the road from the back that I realized the battery of the car had died. We stayed on the side of the road for what seemed like forever, until we decided to pull out the beach chairs to get comfortable. Many people had tried to stop and help us but nobody could successfully get the car to work again.\nInstead of worrying about how late it was getting and how much longer we would be stranded, I ate some chips and listened to music while dancing with the boys. Three hours had passed and my host mom was on her tenth apology. I told her to stop apologizing and threw my arms around her in a huge hug and said that everything was okay. At some point the dad showed up to drive us home, but I was in no rush to leave. He attached our car to his and drove us all home. I didn’t care if we had to stay on the side of the road for five more hours or for the whole night, I only cared that I was with people who love me like I am their own family. \nCheck out more photos from Proctor en Monteverde Winter 2024!",

I put my bathing suit on, grabbed some sunscreen, and got in the car. The beach was called Playa Blanca and was about two hours away. The drive to the beach was beautiful, we passed mountains and mango trees. When we got to the beach I ran right into the water, where I spent most of my time that day along with my host brothers Mattias and Dario. We swam and played games for a while until we got tired. \n\n![Proctor Academy Study Abroad Costa Rica](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1707962295/proctoracademyorg/d7vevxnyecdrh6sf2yjk/IMG_2543.jpg)\n\nWe stayed until the sun began to go down and then packed up our things to start on the long drive back. We had barely made it out of the parking lot when Cynthia stopped the car and got out to check something. She began talking to people around her and the only word that I could understand was ‘mechanic’. It wasn’t until I had to get out of the car and help them push it down the road from the back that I realized the battery of the car had died. We stayed on the side of the road for what seemed like forever, until we decided to pull out the beach chairs to get comfortable. Many people had tried to stop and help us but nobody could successfully get the car to work again.\n\n![Proctor Academy Study Abroad Costa Rica](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1707962164/proctoracademyorg/njhg7jrha5efwkkcqzrl/IMG_2532.jpg)\n\nInstead of worrying about how late it was getting and how much longer we would be stranded, I ate some chips and listened to music while dancing with the boys. Three hours had passed and my host mom was on her tenth apology. I told her to stop apologizing and threw my arms around her in a huge hug and said that everything was okay. At some point the dad showed up to drive us home, but I was in no rush to leave. He attached our car to his and drove us all home. I didn’t care if we had to stay on the side of the road for five more hours or for the whole night, I only cared that I was with people who love me like I am their own family. \n\n## [Check out more photos from Proctor en Monteverde Winter 2024!](https://www.flickr.com/photos/proctoracademy/albums/72177720313825154)"

  "text": "Proctor en Monteverde affords the opportunity for six sophomores to study abroad in Costa Rica each winter and spring trimester. As the spring trimester nears an end, this term's students reflect on their last few weeks in Monteverde. Read more below! \nLAUREN '25 \nThis past Saturday some of us ventured off to support a group that's not yet completely accepted here in Monteverde. The LGBTQ+ community came together to hold the first ever Pride Parade in Monteverde! \nWe all packed the tiny local library the day before the March to create shirts and signs, which is where we met a lot of new people from the Monteverde community. After that we went to a house in town to cut papayas, pineapples and watermelons to provide snacks for everyone who participated in the Parade or the gathering at the end.\nIn the morning we met at the cancha (soccer field) with many people holding signs saying “Amor Es Amor” and other inclusive statements. A samba band played on the bed of a truck and people danced and chanted as we made our way through the streets of town. We ended at an old bull ring where we ate the fruits and sandwiches we had helped make and came together to show our support of each other. \nThis was an experience that I will never forget, where I felt like a part of this community. No matter what barriers we have faced since being here, it feels good to know that I have a place where I can support and be supported.\nNATE '25\nWe sit around the dining room table where we eat dinner and talk about our days. Tonight we are eating rice, beans, and pork. It is a usual dinner in Costa Rica called “casado” which also means marriage because these foods go so well together and make a balanced meal.\nWhen we sit down I say; “Hola, Cinthya; como esta usted?” “Muy bien, gracias, Nate. Y usted?” “Muy bien. Como estan los gatitos hoy?” “Bien, gracias.” It's just another dinner on a Tuesday, but we were happy to be talking to each other without needing any kind of translation.\nFinally, I could have a conversation with my host mom, Cinthya. It's been 2 months, and I can now understand her and respond in Spanish. When I arrived in Costa Rica, I barely knew what \"Hola!\" meant. The first time I met my host family, I was dropped off and stayed with my grandmother, Daisy, and her grandson, Mattias. Both of them knew no English, and I knew no Spanish. It was very awkward for the first hour or two until the rest of my family arrived and my luggage did, too. The only people who spoke English were my host sister Laura and her brother Dario, who loves to play soccer with me. After two months of fewer and fewer awkward interactions, I can finally communicate with them and talk about my day. \nMAIA '25\nI walk in the front door, take my shoes off, throw my backpack in my room, and walk into the kitchen. I grab the ice cream out of the freezer and make myself a bowl. I put it on the table, walk up to the stove, and grab a piece of pasta out of the pot. My host mom gives me a smile. I sit down on the couch with my bowl of ice cream and stretch my legs out to the other side of the couch. After I finish eating, my host mom tells me that she’s very excited to show me something, and insists that Wanda and I follow her to the little cabana on their property that they rent out. We walk around the outside and see the biggest hot tub I’ve ever seen glowing bright blue with Maribelle’s brother, Anthony, sitting inside of it smiling at his work. I felt so happy to be a part of that and have my host mom show me something that she knew I would be excited about. \nWhen I first arrived here I just wanted to hide in my room because I was unsure of how much I was really wanted in the common spaces of the house. I am very happy now knowing that my host family not only wants me around but enjoys my presence.\nPETER '25\nIsaac pointed out a snake and we were all so happy to see it. It was small but it was still really cool. I still don’t know how he saw it; it was brown, sitting on a green leaf in the middle of the night. All we could see was what our flashlights would show us. Mark picked up the snake and it started slithering around his hand. He passed it off to Beto, then Isaac, then Nate. After it almost bit Nate we decided to put the snake back where we found it. \nThat was the second night walk we had done on the San Gerardo trip and it definitely paid off. The first night that we went out we had seen only frogs, even though we were looking for snakes and tarantulas. After seeing none, we were a little bit discouraged but the night walk was still very fun. As we were preparing for the second night walk we realized that we might not see any snakes that night but we still wanted to go out. When Isaac pointed out the snake we all were surprised and very happy. Thank god we decided to go out that second night. \nKHADIJA '25\nAll of my worries left my body as my host mom pulled me in for a big hug. Adjusting to being in Costa Rica was very challenging. Things constantly went through my mind like if I was spending enough time with my host family, if they liked me, missing home, improving my Spanish, and so much more. One night these thoughts hit me like a wave and my host mom could tell I was down. She asked how I was doing and she gave me a big hug cause she knew it was what I needed.\nBRIDGET - Educator\nLife presents us with so many challenges. Traveling is an exciting way to experience the world and learn about ourselves, but if you do it right and really engage with a new place rather than just as a tourist, you will certainly experience some discomfort, maybe even some fear. Over the past weeks the students in the Proctor Monteverde program have done several service projects and other activities, such as working in the CEC school garden, transplanting trees in the rainforest, looking for wildlife in the forest at night, deepening relationships with host families, and exploring the surrounding areas. \nMost helpful to me was the participation in the CEC Earth Day events; I had been put in charge of the day and had to organize all-school activities in short order. The Proctor students helped me brainstorm ideas for events, such as a trash-sorting race and water conservation and seed-planting relays. Then they showed up on the day and ran the events with a rotating group of Spanish-speaking children, giving directions and managing chaos in the hot sun. Then the girls stayed on through their lunch break to help me clean up and put things away. I really appreciate their willingness to put in the effort and put themselves out there!\nCheck out more photos from Proctor en Monteverde!",

After it almost bit Nate we decided to put the snake back where we found it. \n\nThat was the second night walk we had done on the San Gerardo trip and it definitely paid off. The first night that we went out we had seen only frogs, even though we were looking for snakes and tarantulas. After seeing none, we were a little bit discouraged but the night walk was still very fun. As we were preparing for the second night walk we realized that we might not see any snakes that night but we still wanted to go out. When Isaac pointed out the snake we all were surprised and very happy. Thank god we decided to go out that second night. \n\n## KHADIJA '25\n\nAll of my worries left my body as my host mom pulled me in for a big hug. Adjusting to being in Costa Rica was very challenging. Things constantly went through my mind like if I was spending enough time with my host family, if they liked me, missing home, improving my Spanish, and so much more. One night these thoughts hit me like a wave and my host mom could tell I was down. She asked how I was doing and she gave me a big hug cause she knew it was what I needed.\n\n## BRIDGET - Educator\n\nLife presents us with so many challenges. Traveling is an exciting way to experience the world and learn about ourselves, but if you do it right and really engage with a new place rather than just as a tourist, you will certainly experience some discomfort, maybe even some fear. Over the past weeks the students in the Proctor Monteverde program have done several service projects and other activities, such as working in the CEC school garden, transplanting trees in the rainforest, looking for wildlife in the forest at night, deepening relationships with host families, and exploring the surrounding areas. \n\nMost helpful to me was the participation in the CEC Earth Day events; I had been put in charge of the day and had to organize all-school activities in short order. The Proctor students helped me brainstorm ideas for events, such as a trash-sorting race and water conservation and seed-planting relays. Then they showed up on the day and ran the events with a rotating group of Spanish-speaking children, giving directions and managing chaos in the hot sun. Then the girls stayed on through their lunch break to help me clean up and put things away. I really appreciate their willingness to put in the effort and put themselves out there!\n\n[Check out more photos from Proctor en Monteverde!](https://www.flickr.com/photos/proctoracademy/albums/72177720307557809)"

  "text": "Apr 15 2023 9:44 PM \nProctor’s sophomore study abroad program in Monteverde, Costa Rica is underway for the spring trimester as six students immerse themselves in Costa Rican culture. Students share their perspectives following their first weeks living with host families and studying abroad. Read more below! \nMaia ‘25: \nThere is so much to reflect on as our first full school week in Monteverde Costa Rica comes to a close. In the past few weeks, we have experienced so many new things as a group, and separately with our host families. We started our journey at Boston Logan Airport, took a short flight into JFK, and then a much longer flight into Liberia as a group. This was my first time traveling without my parents, but it was very comforting to be traveling with the group and it made a world of difference. After we landed in Costa Rica, Kathia picked us up and brought us to Playa Hermosa where we would be spending our first couple of days at a hotel as a sort of orientation. It was so amazing to be at the beach with everyone for those two nights and get to know each other, while also learning more about the journey we were about to embark on.\nAfter the three days were up, we all got into Kathia’s van and took a three-hour drive to Monteverde where I was the first to be dropped off with my host family. I was super nervous until the moment I met my host mom and she gave me a huge hug and told me how excited she was to have me here. My Spanish has already improved tremendously because of school and living with a Spanish-speaking family. We have had an amazing week academically and it has been so fun to get to know all of our teachers. A highlight from this week was hiking through the Cloud Forest on Saturday with our science teacher Beto, and learning about the wildlife.\nOn Monday we got to go to Kathia's farm that she owns with her husband. It was our first time going so she gave us a tour of the whole farm. We learned about the different responsibilities that they have on the farm such as feeding all the animals, and milking the cows. They have six horses that they have rescued from many different situations and it is amazing to see all the animals living together. We all got to ride one of the horses bareback which was so much fun. My favorite part about the farm was all of the baby cows that they had. They were so friendly and fun to be around. I am very excited to go back next week, and hope that we will get to do some more hands-on work.\nIsaac ‘25\nOn Monday, we ended our day by going to Kathia's ranch. She showed us all of her animals and how her husband, Celimo, runs them. Near the end of our stay, we got to ride horses for a bit, just to get a feel for what it's like for people who have never ridden horses before. None of us had ridden a horse without a saddle before so it was an interesting experience! Nonetheless, it was super fun and Celimo showed us how to ride them properly and what not to do when riding a horse.\nLauren ‘25\nBeing in Costa Rica has made me realize how much a good sunset can bring together a group of people, from the first night of being in Costa Rica when everyone in the community packed the beach in Playa Hermosa and joined in a beach soccer game, to having a picnic with my host family one of the first nights on top of a mountain. Here, things move pretty fast, but a beautiful sunset is enough to stop many people for enough time to take a breath and enjoy this beautiful place and the people here too!\nNathan ‘25 \nWe stayed at the beach of Playa Hermosa for the first few days. It was scorching hot getting up to 97 degrees almost every day so the beach was a must. The first day was spent exploring the town we were in and going to check out the sunset. \nThe two days that followed were filled with getting to know each other and spending time at the beach. We met a local selling shaved ice who Isaac and I immediately loved, he would beep his horn on his cart and bark at dogs as they went by. We found an iguana and he wanted to eat it so Lauren, Isaac, the local, and I tried to catch them. That day was primarily spent on the beach looking to catch iguanas, but later in the day, we played soccer, creating some good memories before we left for Monteverde.\nKhadija '25\nWhen I first arrived at my host family I was very nervous about meeting them, I had no idea what to expect and I had no previous experience with something like this. The sisters gave me a warm welcome as soon as I got there and we watched a movie together. At this moment I knew that I would be ok. It was tough at first because it wasn’t easy to settle in since you’re with a whole new family but they make all the difference by making you feel welcomed into their home. Living with a host family comes with its challenges because when you don’t know a lot of Spanish, things can get miscommunicated, or not knowing exactly how much time you should be spending with them but these problems are easily resolved. My host mother is very caring and loving and she really helped me feel at home through this process. She makes sure I’m fed, that my clothes are clean, and that I’m feeling comfortable in the house. My experience living with a host family has been great and I’m very grateful for each of them.",

What is it that allows Proctor’s unique culture to thrive year after year? How do we cultivate continuity when we welcome new faculty, staff, and students to Proctor’s community each year? \nA few years ago, Head of School Mike Henriques shared a letter with faculty and staff this morning in which he reminded us of our important roles in the year ahead. “We are stewards of Proctor. Each one of us plays a role, each role is critical, and all of us make a difference in the community. We are charged with sustaining it, growing it, evolving it. No matter whether you are teaching calculus, sharpening skates, cleaning dorms, building a budget, making snow, throwing a pot, mowing grass, giving extra help, driving to a game, or any of the thousands of small actions of community, when we bend to the task, wholly committing, we move the school forward. When we do it with intentionality and purpose, we evolve. Become better. For many, that commitment renews at the end of the summer, which is true for me, even as the summer continues to be busier than ever. Our task, whether we are just joining the community or have been here for thirty years, is to support our students and this school, commit to growing as an individual, and finding joy in the journey.” \nIn just over a week, our first new students arrive on campus and begin their Proctor journey in the same way every other Proctor student has since 1971: Wilderness Orientation. The brainchild of former Head of School David Fowler and Assistant Head of School Chris Norris, Wilderness Orientation is one of Proctor’s programs that most effectively weaves mission, program, and people into an incredibly powerful, complex, cultural underpinning of Proctor. For more than 50 years years, the five day, four night backpacking trip in the White Mountains has bonded groups of eight students and two faculty members through the shared experiences only the wilderness can teach.\nFaculty orientation leaders began a two day SOLO Wilderness First Aid training this morning reminding us of the institutional commitment required to sustain a program like Wilderness Orientation. The time, planning, food and gear prep, permitting, and route planning to send 140 students and 36 leaders into the White Mountains is overwhelming for the casual observer, but for a logistical genius like Wilderness Orientation Coordinator Kayden Will, it is her contribution to the continuity of culture at Proctor. Everyone in the community rallies and does their individual part to support the collective effort. Quite simply, we believe the experience of Wilderness Orientation catalyzes the relationships that serve as the foundation of Proctor’s culture, and it is worth our time, energy, and investment to ensure we are prepared, trained, and equipped to have the best start to the year possible. \nTwenty-five years ago, David Fowler was entering his 25th, and final, year as Proctor’s Head of School when he wrote the following to faculty and staff, “One of the reasons Proctor has done so well over the years is due to its clear mission. Our job is to support that mission in all we do. The mission dictates the programs that we have, the values that we feel are important, and the type of student we want to have at the school. If we forget who we are and who we are committed to serve, then the clear purpose of the school is clouded and frustration and confusion can sap our energies and educational commitment.” The mission he stewarded is the same mission Heads of School Steve Wilkins (1995-2005), Mike Henriques (2005-2021), and Brian Thomas (2021-Present) have stewarded since alongside the hundreds of faculty and staff who have dedicated their lives to Proctor. \nCollectively, we have kept Proctor’s mission clearly in focus. We have resisted the temptations to stray off the path, to take the easy trail, to bend to the fears of those who do not fully understand why we do what we do. There have been (and will continue to be) moments when the execution of a program like Wilderness Orientation simply feels like too much. But, when we have a mission that centers us, and a community that believes in that mission, we hold the course. We do the hard things because we believe in their impact on our community and their contribution to our continuity of culture, a continuity so many organizations lack. We prepare our bags, lace up our boots, pack our gorp and sleeping bags, and embark on the best, hardest five days of the year.",
  "markdown": "How does the culture of an organization sustain over time? Is it the people? Is it the mission? Is it the programs offered? What is it that allows Proctor’s unique culture to thrive year after year? How do we cultivate continuity when we welcome new faculty, staff, and students to Proctor’s community each year? \n\n![Proctor Academy Wilderness Orientation](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1678637139/proctoracademyorg/acl024j8b0ebxgst6ewx/WO11.jpg)\n\nA few years ago, Head of School Mike Henriques shared a letter with faculty and staff this morning in which he reminded us of our important roles in the year ahead. “We are stewards of Proctor. Each one of us plays a role, each role is critical, and all of us make a difference in the community. We are charged with sustaining it, growing it, evolving it. No matter whether you are teaching calculus, sharpening skates, cleaning dorms, building a budget, making snow, throwing a pot, mowing grass, giving extra help, driving to a game, or any of the thousands of small actions of community, when we bend to the task, wholly committing, we move the school forward. When we do it with intentionality and purpose, we evolve. Become better.  For many, that commitment renews at the end of the summer, which is true for me, even as the summer continues to be busier than ever. Our task, whether we are just joining the community or have been here for thirty years, is to support our students and this school, commit to growing as an individual, and finding joy in the journey.” \n\n![Proctor Academy Wilderness Orientation](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1678637166/proctoracademyorg/xts6juhqrzke1h7xrflw/WO12.jpg)\n\nIn just over a week, our first new students arrive on campus and begin their Proctor journey in the same way every other Proctor student has since 1971: Wilderness Orientation.

  "text": "Sep 5 2023 1:30 PM \nThere are moments in our lives as parents, moments we can anticipate but never fully appreciate, where we realize this life is not about us or our achievements, but about empowering our children to become the humans they are meant to be. These moments are hard, joyful, painful, and cut to the bone of our existence as parents. Today is one of those moments for those of us who are new Proctor parents. \nFrom that first sleepless night in the hospital wondering how we could ever have been trusted to steward the little life that lies in our arms, our children teach us how to simultaneously hold onto their being with all that we have, while gradually letting that life blossom into its own. Through each milestone - their first steps, learning to ride a two wheeler, losing their first tooth, going off to their first day of school, their first play date, their first broken bone, their first sleepover - we watch as our children step forward with the confidence we hoped they would have, but that we haven’t quite granted them ourselves. We watch them stumble and fall and get back up, hell bent on being more independent than we are ready to accept. \nWe learn to gradually trust that our cumulative work, the never-ending, ceaseless love that we have poured into our children, has prepared them for what’s next. We trust that we have done enough to lay a foundation that will allow them to pursue their dreams, even when those dreams feel impossibly hard for our jaded adult brains to embrace. We trust that our role as parents will be supplemented by, not replaced by, other adults in their lives at Proctor, working together to solidify the foundation on which they are building their lives. \nAs we walked away from our oldest son, leaving him in the able hands of his Wilderness Orientation leaders, the advice I have written to parents over the past decade on this day hit a little closer to home. That bittersweet feeling of pride in the young person you have helped raise and the very real sense of loss you feel as they walk away from you into that which you have been praying they experience ties a knot in your stomach unlike any words on a page can describe. \nIt is in this moment of watching your child walk into their next big adventure that we have to remind each other that the letting go is even more important than the holding tight. Our children are capable of so much more than we think they are. They are ready, even when we realize we might not be. Our job, right now, is to let them walk with their own confidence into that which awaits them while we stand, hand in hand with each other as parents, beaming with pride in who our children have become as we smile and mourn and watch them continue to blossom. \nThe genius of Bob Dylan’s lyrics to Forever Young have served as a good reminder that the emotions we are experiencing right now are not novel, but a song resonating in the hearts of all parents who have been fortunate enough to have their children launch into the world. \nMay God bless and keep you always\nMay your wishes all come true\nMay you always do for others\nAnd let others do for you\nMay you build a ladder to the stars\nAnd climb on every rung\nMay you stay forever young\nMay you stay forever young\nMay you grow up to be righteous\nMay you grow up to be true\nMay you always know the truth\nAnd see the light surrounding you\nMay you always be courageous\nStand upright and be strong\nMay you stay forever young\nMay you stay forever young\nMay your hands always be busy\nMay your feet always be swift\nMay you have a strong foundation\nWhen the winds of changes shift\nMay your heart always be joyful\nMay your song always be sung\nAnd may you stay forever young\nMay you stay forever young\nCheck out more photos from the start of the year!",

  "text": "Jan 4 2023 8:42 AM \nLater this afternoon we will welcome students back from break for the heart of the winter term. The dining hall will gradually come to life, dorms will fill with hugs, stories from the past two weeks, and anticipation of what lies ahead. Moments like tonight, when we see our students joyously reconnecting with each other, stand in stark contrast to the realities of disconnect and mental health struggles facing so many. \nA powerful morning of professional development with Samaritans Hope Suicide Prevention network brought to light the crisis of mental health in our country, and in the teenage community specifically. Loneliness, suicidal ideation, and mental health struggles are a part of the Proctor landscape among our students and our employees, just as they are in every school community around the country. Today’s training helped us become better adept at identifying individuals who are struggling and knowing how to proactively offer the support they need. \nIn 2018, we shared THIS blog post about how Proctor can serve as an antidote to loneliness. Its message rings as true today as it did almost five years ago. In it, we shared, “Proctor’s antidote to loneliness is not a single program or wellness initiative. It is an educational model whose foundation is grounded in community building at both the student and adult level.” From the moment students step onto campus, and into our lives, our work is to facilitate connection. Period. It happens on Wilderness Orientation, in small, family-style dorms, on teams and afternoon activities, in advisories, and through myriad other moments in a student’s life. \nKathryn, our facilitator from Samaritans this morning, shared a quote from author and activist Parker Palmer, “The human soul doesn't want to be advised or fixed or saved. It simply wants to be witnessed.” Palmer’s words serve as a simple reminder that the most powerful moments of connection for our students are not some grand, transformational event, but through the simple act of seeing them and accepting them for who they are. \nOur work as we welcome students back to campus is to find those small, simple moments of witnessing others in the community: say hello by name when walking between classes, ask genuine questions about others to learn about their life’s experiences, slow down and engage in a meaningful way with those in our classes, teams, and dorms. We know mental health challenges are a part of every community's landscape, and we must work tirelessly to help those around us know they are loved, valued, and supported. \nLearn more about Samaritans Hope and their work around suicide prevention and education HERE.",

  "text": "If we are honest with ourselves, teenagers are equal parts frustrating and equal parts energizing. We have moments in our classes, with our teams, or in our advisories where our students make us laugh, inspire us to dig deeper, think more critically, and do our best work. And then we have moments where we want to pull our hair out and question our career choice. \nIn those moments of frustration, we have to remind ourselves that this is our work as a school. It is to take the unformed prefrontal cortexes of adolescents and help them become just a bit more formed, while providing guidance, love, encouragement, and accountability along the way. Our work is pretty simple, actually, in that every generation of teenagers is remarkably similar. Of course there are different stressors in their lives, different distractions from homework, and different threats to mental health, but deep down, adolescents today are very similar to adolescents forty years ago. \nOn November 12, Proctor hosted the 20th Anniversary Skate for Ted alongside the family of Proctor alum Teddy Maloney ‘88 (who lost his life in 9/11). Family and friends from New York and Connecticut joined Proctor alumni and faculty for a skate commemorating the 20th anniversary of the opening of the Teddy Maloney ‘88 Hockey Rink. During the opening remarks of the event, Dean of Faculty Karl Methven took the microphone and shared memories of his former advisee and goalie, Teddy. \nKarl’s wisdom after 42 years teaching, coaching, and leading Proctor always provides a perspective that many of us younger faculty need to hear. “On a bookshelf in my office is a collection of plaques, pictures, thank you notes. It is actually a culture wall. It is an expression of beliefs and values and people and moments. On one of those shelves is a picture, cracked and colorful, of Teddy on his graduation day standing next to his father. It’s a great memory, but for me it is not just a memory. It is a reminder of who these kids are when they arrive and what they need. When they arrive at Proctor, they are not yet, they are still becoming, they are adolescents.” \n“We shouldn’t be surprised if we see some rascally, inconsistent, erratic, ‘What the hell were you thinking’ behavior. That’s just who they are at that moment, like we were. And what they need from us is to believe in who they could become, who they are going to be. They need to believe we have confidence in who they will become. They need to trust that we are not going to quit on them and that we are always going to be there. So that picture of Teddy is not just a reminder, it’s a lesson for me, and I’m very grateful for it. Let’s have a good skate.” \nSometimes we can overthink our work as educators. We can spend all of our time seeking to create the perfect lesson plan, the most creative assessment, or the flawless game plan for our team. This preparation and planning work is important, but it must be done in conjunction with a plan for connection. Karl is right, what our kids really need from us is to know that we believe in who they could become. \nThis is our purpose and our direction, especially during these winter months when sickness, cold weather, and dark days can overshadow all the good that is happening in our classes, teams, dorms, and advisories. Each day, we just do our best to show up for our kids, letting them know that we will never, ever quit on them.",

  "text": "Any given day at Proctor is filled with a thousand interactions: teachers, friends, dorm parents, roommates, parents, coaches, teammates, advisors, dining staff, housekeepers in dorms. It is these varied conversations, and the energy they generate, that make up the many pieces of the jigsaw puzzle that is our life at Proctor. \nWhen I asked a colleague how he was doing three weeks into the new year, his response was both honest and insightful: “Well, I am certainly not bored.” Sometimes it can feel overwhelming as we bounce between responsibilities, activities, and commitments, but the varied nature of our jobs and our life at boarding school keeps us energized unlike any other profession. We look forward to each day, largely, because we only have a rough idea of what it will hold: variety, relationships, and a shared responsibility to make this school the best place it can be. Our students feel the same way. The busyness makes us complete. Let us walk you through yesterday’s schedule to see the fullness of life at Proctor. \nFaculty kick off each Wednesday with either an all-faculty meeting or department meeting before jumping into their 8:30 am first block class. Any given day of classes has students in the woodlands, in more traditional classrooms, in the technology lab learning about 3D printing, in Slocumb Hall studying studio art, ceramics, and photography, in the recording studio, in the woodshop or machine shop or forge, spending time with Learning Specialists in Learning Skills, or sampling the water in the pond for biology class, or potting plants for botany class. While we have an academic schedule that provides a framework to our academic day, the actual experience varies tremendously. \nWhile we do not gather for assembly or advisory on Wednesdays, they are perhaps the most full days of our week as an abridged academic schedule (three class blocks instead of five) affords the opportunities for our athletic teams to compete against other independent schools in the region, and for our other afternoon programs to have an extended period of time for rehearsal, splitting wood, or traveling to a local river to kayak. \nYesterday afternoon, Proctor’s campus was a hub of activity as our mountain biking team hosted the first Northern New England Mountain Biking Series race at the Proctor Ski Area. With over 400 riders from more than 20 schools in attendance, coaches Josh Norris, Chris Farrell, Chris Grotnes, Jen Summers, and Justin Sperry deserve a huge round of applause for pulling off three separate starts and an amazing day of riding on Proctor’s trails! \nOn the other side of the Blackwater River, Carr Field hosted a girls jv soccer match against St. Paul’s School (a 2-1 victory for the Hornets!), while over on Farrell Field both varsity field hockey (1-0 win over Kimball Union Academy) and girls varsity soccer (0-2 loss to Austin Prep) battled in front of a great crowd. \nAs teams trickled back to campus from away games over the dinner hour, students shared tales of competition with their friends and faculty before heading to extra help sessions and study hall from 7:30-9:30 PM. Whether studying in dorms or in the Lovejoy Library, students prepare for the day ahead before winding down. \nAs our heads hit our pillows each night, we are reminded that while some days may feel long, the years are short. We embrace the busyness of each day, the feeling that we have puzzle pieces strewn about the table of our lives, because we know that without any one piece of the puzzle, our lives would be incomplete. \nClick here to check out daily life at Proctor on Instagram!",

We embrace the busyness of each day, the feeling that we have puzzle pieces strewn about the table of our lives, because we know that without any one piece of the puzzle, our lives would be incomplete. \n\n[Click here to check out daily life at Proctor on Instagram!](https://blogs.proctoracademy.org/cs/c/?cta_guid=55771e57-828e-4b83-923f-ca2d836a9f76&signature=AAH58kFqKnAKsAo7GeW4PgrVpAawfqiBBg&pageId=85736102452&placement_guid=510eb99c-cb77-492f-be80-e3403b0322bd&click=030764f1-c92d-43f7-80d4-f4743075274f&hsutk=8380f9b086d8c936a008226094ed485e&canon=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.proctoracademy.org%2Fa-day-in-the-life-the-many-puzzle-pieces-of-proctor&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&portal_id=408790&redirect_url=APefjpEsw-AXjDDGiUnmlY_AUyL142td6GPrsqbhuq1Fhq69I--fGB2irii71kuEWsjZAtEWAGjN4nVy7ZJtdIKKubhcFMjmopWgIpuPRPKOTEU5vfjODLWx6CDijO6iRqmjLFc6CXAuMbnN4eNfG_GbVYXVg7JGKpfht7Vjws9GPkPW_PX1mt06qPnJlhGdfIm7vPAvBZlgYY9N0SrHlUK_ZeusBNDKPfNTENCZNbAuRLEbyRPy_V3o6PgW8nssBwoLW7GCU-ggaaL7NGpNsC0CUFodeMdukA&__hstc=64846384.8380f9b086d8c936a008226094ed485e.1662494660989.1678666752237.1678707883422.387&__hssc=64846384.19.1678707883422&__hsfp=1411068630&contentType=blog-post \"Click here to check out daily life at Proctor on Instagram!\")"

  "text": "Most people who don’t work with teenagers have a preconceived notion of who they are and what they are. In other words, they don’t really know them. At Proctor, we celebrate the awesomeness of teenagers everyday and in every way.\nListen to Brian's Blog Post HERE\nIn fact, in the most mundane and ordinary of places – at the airport, at a dinner party, in casual conversations, and in nearly every place I travel – whenever I meet non-school people who are unconnected to schools and who hear that I work in a high school, and a boarding school at that, it’s clear they don’t get teenagers–at all. They say something to the effect of, “Man, that must be a tough job you have!” Or, “What did they do to get ‘sent away’?” I always cock my head sideways, just a little like a dog hearing a tennis shoe scrape across a hardwood floor, and say something back like, “When was the last time you were in a school?” Or, “Have you ever heard of ‘Proctor Academy’?” \nSadly, they often haven’t. \nAt Proctor, we take that knowing and understanding of teenagers to a whole new level of explaining the myriad of “why” teenagers get the rap they get. If you were looking for that view on teens, especially Proctor teens, then let me explain to you three reasons why I think they are amazing creatures.\nFirst, they are funny in spite of themselves. Teenagers understand that they must create, in their safe groups, a way to make their lives fun and livable. They laugh hard and heartily at the “everyday-ness” and the “ordinary” of life. They word play, and point out the inanity in the lives and rules of adults. They see the world often as the way that it should be, without compromising what it actually is at times. They go on, like Sisyphus and his boulder, back up the proverbial hill, only to watch the big rocks of their current lives roll back down the hill to the bottom. Do they get a bit funky and depressed from disappointment? Certainly, they do. But instead of like Albert Camus’ “The Myth of Sisyphus,” they go skipping back down the hill, trying to find not the same size rock but one that might be easier to handle and to roll – up. What examples do I have of their mirth and merriment in the phase of what ordinary mortals might call defeat and loss? Just ride back on a team bus after a horrendous blowout loss to a rival. As a reasonably sane competitive adult, I think, “What the heck, I would be crushed, if I were them.” Oftentimes, they are a bit down, but not for long. It’s not like they don’t care. It’s just that they have to get up the next morning and go to school, and they’re hungry. After a Chipotle or McDonalds or Kwik Mart later, they are different; they don’t do what normal adult people might do. They get over it, knowing that there are other losses and wins on the horizon for them to chase and roll.\nTwo, teenagers love trying to understand what it means to be just. Oftentimes it comes across as annoying to adults. But teenagers have a keen sense of justice for themselves and for their fellow students. They regale each other with stories about fairness, but they come to understand that they don’t live in an ideal or just world sometimes. They certainly may wish to, but they get soon enough that life can be tough for some, and even for them at times. After all, they have all of those people judging them all the time for what they are not. “Well, back in my day…” Teens roll their eyes at the “back in my day-ers,” sometimes just to spite them. Teens are also awesome because they know that their lives may be altered by the adults who have botched this whole climate change and racial equity thing, among other issues. And yet, they still join clubs, play games, attend practices, laugh at third grade bathroom humor, and respect the hierarchy and fallibility of their fellow humans, namely adults; adults who sometimes have a hard time acknowledging their foibles, mistakes, and vulnerabilities. These people, these teens have a keen sense of fairness that is rooted in being in a place, especially here in this place – Proctor – that nurtures that sense of love for the individual connecting to the wider community.\nLast but not least, the teenage brains are still growing and adapting, requiring fuel in the worst way, yet also understanding that they are here – at Proctor – to become the people they were always meant to be. That means that they will make a ton of mistakes and a ton of friends. They rub each other the wrong way, yet they love each other like there is no tomorrow. Exhibit A for this is simply the opening week and weeks of school here at Proctor. Our students have grown inches and brain matter in a very short amount of time. Sure, their amygdalas get hijacked often, when they get homesick, and they are bulking up on their gray matter’s prefrontal cortex throughout the time that we have them. Yet, their brains change for the better at Proctor because we love challenging them to do the hard and uncomfortable stuff that stretches beyond what they ever thought possible. The world teaches them that. We point out these bigger than life lessons while we have them. We know that this time will be more memorable because while we have them, we understand that what they learn the most and the deepest may be more than what’s in the four walls of a classroom. It is the place they long to be–and we know it!\nThat is why our model of education at Proctor is so important. That is why we have stood the test of time. 175 years to be exact. The awesomeness of teenagers resounds through the walls and halls, across the forests and oceans, in Spain and France, and across the deserts of the American Southwest. Indeed, the awesomeness of teenagers is more than them being funny, just, or big brained. It means they get to roll up their sleeves and get down to business so that they can leave behind the trappings of childhood to become something more meaningful, more meaningful than even being an adult, to become human, empathetic, rational, and caring–now and forever.\nBrian W. Thomas, Proctor Academy Head of School \nCurated Reading and Listening:\nThe poet Billy Collins explains what is so apt and so right about the awesomeness of teenagers in “The Days of Teen-age Glory.” From the New Yorker, read and listen to it HERE.",

Sure, their amygdalas get hijacked often, when they get homesick, and they are bulking up on their gray matter’s prefrontal cortex throughout the time that we have them. Yet, their brains change for the better at Proctor because we love challenging them to do the hard and uncomfortable stuff that stretches beyond what they ever thought possible. The world teaches them that. We point out these bigger than life lessons while we have them. We know that this time will be more memorable because while we have them, we understand that what they learn the most and the deepest may be more than what’s in the four walls of a classroom. It is the place they long to be–and we know it!\n\nThat is why our model of education at Proctor is so important. That is why we have stood the test of time. 175 years to be exact. The awesomeness of teenagers resounds through the walls and halls, across the forests and oceans, in Spain and France, and across the deserts of the American Southwest. Indeed, the awesomeness of teenagers is more than them being funny, just, or big brained. It means they get to roll up their sleeves and get down to business so that they can leave behind the trappings of childhood to become something more meaningful, more meaningful than even being an adult, to become human, empathetic, rational, and caring–now and forever.\n\n![Brian_Thomas_Signature_firstonly](https://blogs.proctoracademy.org/hs-fs/hubfs/Brian_Thomas_Signature_firstonly.png?width=98&name=Brian_Thomas_Signature_firstonly.png)\n\nBrian W. Thomas, Proctor Academy Head of School \n\n## Curated Reading and Listening:\n\nThe poet Billy Collins explains what is so apt and so right about the awesomeness of teenagers in “The Days of Teen-age Glory.” From the New Yorker, read and listen to it [HERE](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/03/22/days-of-teen-age-glory)."

As a boarding school, this liminal emotional and physical space for our students fills much of their day; the moments between classes, on the periphery of meals, after classes conclude before afternoon activities begin, following dinner before extra help sessions and study hall, and then following study hall before lights turn off and the day is done. \nThe vast majority of the photos, video, and writing we share on social media and our website focus on our educational, athletic, and off-campus programs. We struggle, as most schools do, to fully capture the liminal space for our students, even though it is in those “between” spaces that life happens for our students. It is the conversations with friends, the game of pool in the Wise Center before class, the walk to JJ’s for a breakfast sandwich, the hanging out on the turf, in the gym, or in the dorm where a student’s residential life experience happens. Our goal for our students is to provide as much predictability, certainty, safety, and comfort to those between times in their life. \nAs we considered how to articulate Proctor’s residential life program to prospective families, we asked students and dorm parents about their experiences living, learning, and monitoring those in-between times in daily life at Proctor. The video below emphasizes what we feel each day as we live alongside our students: relationships and connection are absolutely central to the residential life experience at Proctor. \nAs we work to create a school community that supports students and all of the complexities they bring to their adolescent years, we double down on the importance of ensuring our students feel connected.

  "text": "Mar 12 2023 9:03 AM \nAttending boarding school (even as a day student) is a big step for families to take, but one we believe affords students (and parents) incredible opportunities for growth. We’ve written about this before, but an excerpt from Julie Lythcott-Haims’ book, How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success published on Slate.com reinforces the value of boarding school.\nLythcott-Haims writes, “As parents, our intentions are sound—more than sound: We love our kids fiercely and want only the very best for them. Yet, having succumbed to a combination of safety fears, a college admissions arms race, and perhaps our own needy ego, our sense of what is ‘best’ for our kids is completely out of whack.” In a complementary piece, Price of Privilege, Madeline Levine describes three ways we might be over-parenting:\nWhen we do for our kids what they can already do for themselves,\nWhen we do for our kids what they can almost do for themselves; and\nWhen our parenting behavior is motivated by our own egos.\nThis over-parenting in early adolescence has been linked to challenges in development throughout emerging adulthood. Lythcott-Haims writes, “When seemingly perfectly healthy, but over-parented, kids get to college and have trouble coping with the various new situations they might encounter they can have real difficulty knowing how to handle the disagreement, the uncertainty, the hurt feelings, or the decision-making process. This inability to cope—to sit with some discomfort, think about options, talk it through with someone, make a decision—can become a problem unto itself.”\nWe are thankful Proctor is able to serve as a safe transition ground as students take a step toward independence. Central to Proctor’s school culture, and wholly integrated into our curriculum, is the often under-appreciated skill of self-advocacy. Understanding where resources and support exist, and knowing how to ask for directions, clarification, or assistance are skills most high school students are not required to develop to the same degree as boarding school students. Whether it is through an advisor, dorm parent, teacher, or coach, Proctor’s on- and off-campus programs explicitly teach students how to manage their newfound independence, while implicitly reinforcing these lessons by asking students to consistently step outside their comfort zones.\nProctor’s motto since its earliest years has been: Live to Learn. Learn to Live. In order to do either, a student must ‘own’ their educational journey. Parents must let this ownership take place. Know that you will not be the first to pull away from campus nervous about your child having newfound independence at boarding school. Know also that you will not be the first to see an absolute transformation in your child’s self-confidence because of the educational journey you have allowed them to take at Proctor. Sometimes it takes a leap of faith to take flight.",

  "text": "Feb 7 2024 10:58 AM \nIn the highly competitive Lakes Region, Proctor’s varsity boys hockey team competes against some of the strongest teams in New England prep hockey. With a veteran roster, complemented by a talented group of newcomers, this year’s squad has earned quality wins against top teams, while working to find their rhythm as a group. Currently, the Hornets sit at fourth place in the Lakes Region and will look to make a run at a league championship during the final two weeks of the season. \nHear more about the boys varsity hockey’s season from captains Nolan Davis ‘24 and Ty Gwatkin ‘24 in this week’s team spotlight. \nHow have you, as captains, worked to support your teammates over the course of the season so that as a team you can keep improving? \nNolan ‘24: For me personally, just trying to lead by example and show up everyday with a mind set of getting better and I think that in itself is contagious and leads to group improvement.\nTy ‘24: As captains, we like to be the bridge between coaches and players. If there are concerns of any kind among the players or the coaches, Nolan and I are happy to receive that information and relay it to whoever needs it in order to improve the morale of the team. It has also been important to me this year to always remember the spotlight I am under as a senior captain. With that in mind, I always want to provide a good example for the younger guys of a hard worker on the ice, in the classroom, in the weight room, and around campus. \nLooking at the final three weeks of your season where do you, as a group, hope to be heading into the Lakes Region playoffs? \nNolan ‘24: I think our group is just looking to click and get hot going into the final stretch. We feel really good about our group and know that now is the time to make a big push to achieve our goals.\nTy ‘24: We are right where we want to be at this point in the season. We are finally finding our groove and playing to our true potential which will be very important heading into a time of year when teams can lose touch with the locker room and begin thinking about moving on to the next thing. With KUA and Holderness having great teams this year, we are looking to remain in the 3rd slot in the Lakes Region playoffs and attempt to make a run for a banner. We have three very winnable Lakes Region home games at the end of the season which we look to solidify our standing in the lakes region and NEPSAC playoffs. \nWhat do you love about Proctor's hockey program and hope to leave as a legacy for next year's guys? \nNolan ‘24: I just love the family atmosphere that comes with being a member of Proctor hockey. The bonds you create from this locker room are really special and last a life time. I hope that we leave behind a good culture, both on and off the ice. Being a good classmate, teammate and member of the community I hope is something that is instilled into the group and carries over to future teams.\nTy ‘24: When I think about my time on the Proctor hockey team over my four years, the first thing I think of is the characters in the locker room. No matter where we stand in New England or what our record is, there always seems to be a group of guys that come together and form a uniquely memorable bond that carries past the hockey season. I will always remember the locker room culture at Proctor and want all the younger guys to know that your teammates will always have your back. I would also like to preach the idea of being a valuable member of the community. The legacy I would like to leave behind is that outside of the rink, create unexpected relationships, ask questions of mentors that know more than you, and give back to Proctor in any way possible.\nFollow Proctor Boys Hockey on Instagram!",

  "text": "The level of play in the world of prep school girls hockey has evolved considerably over the last decade. As the depth of talent, commitment, and overall competition increases, Proctor’s girls hockey coaches and team continue to work hard to develop a cohesive, supportive team culture that will unites the team both on and off the ice. With a recent win over Brooks School, Proctor’s girls varsity hockey team looks to build on recent momentum as they head into the second half of the season. Read more about the 2023-2024 squad from the perspective of coaches and captains in this week’s team spotlight below. \nHow has this group worked during the first half of the season to find a rhythm as a group? \nJodie Gratton (Captain): We have worked really well together so far this year. Before the season starts we try and get out on the ice together as much as we can. It’s always fun having new players join our team because everyone always brings something different and unique to the team. We have created a family on the team and we keep getting stronger as the season goes on. \nHunter Churchill ‘01 (Head Coach): We established a goal early to minimize the \"noise\", the outside distractions. Allowing us to be present with each other in the locker room and on the ice. This year’s leadership has helped build a strong level of commitment along with consistency in our pregame warmups. \nKate Piacenza (Assistant Coach): This year is unique as we have a young team for the first time in years. This has allowed us to establish an identity of playing as a unit, working hard through adversity, and having a belief that we can always expect more out of ourselves. We have a group of coachable players who want to get better. As a result, we have seen an improvement in our passing, breakouts, and zone entry.\nWhat do you love most about playing for Proctor's hockey program?\nJodie: Proctors hockey program is very special to me and will always hold a special place in my heart. Some days I’ll have a bad day and I can always count on my team to make it better . We have so much grit and determination on our team and it’s truly inspiring. We don’t have as many players like other teams do but we still show up to every game with that determination to win.\nHow have you worked to build a supportive team culture that allows you to compete in a very talented, deep prep hockey schedule?\nJodi: I believe it starts off the ice and we do little things like putting our phones away once we step into the locker room before our game, going around the locker room and telling each other our personal and team goals for the game , team breakfast, and even little things like all matching and wearing our team jackets to the game. The chemistry starts off the ice and we have prioritized that the whole season and it carries onto the ice and helps our play.\nHunter: It is difficult to win games in this league, every opponent can put pucks in your net in a game played fast and physical. Keeping emotions in check is key as you learn from mistakes and trust that you are always capable of more. It has shown this year with some tough losses and big wins. This team is young and excited to play, as coaches we are lucky to have such a positive team ready for the challenges they face. \nKate: We have worked to cultivate a supportive culture by committing to focusing on hockey when we touch the ice, holding each other accountable while letting each player be themselves, and caring about team success over individual success. I love coaching this team because kids want to be there and hear advice, ask the right questions, and support each other. They do all of this while having fun, keeping the environment light, and never taking themselves too seriously. This makes practice and games the part of my day that I look forward to the most.\nLooking ahead to the rest of your season, what goals do you have as a team?\nJodi: We have gotten better each game and I think just taking what we learn in practice and applying that in the game will continue to help us. A lot of teams underestimate us as a team and that fuels us to beat them. We all know keeping the game simple and just playing how we know how to play is going to be the key to success and having a successful season.\nHunter: We look at the game in three zones; offensive, neutral, and defensive. We have seen improvement in all three but still have work to do. Our goal is to continue to develop our systems and techniques so that we can put together complete games consistently. All three periods, all three zones. \nKate: Our goals for the rest of the season are to beat some of our Lakes Region rivals so we can be ranked top 4 in the league and play for a league title in the Lakes Region tournament.\nCheck out other Team Spotlights here!",

As a result, we have seen an improvement in our passing, breakouts, and zone entry.\n\n![Proctor Academy Athletics](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1705958137/proctoracademyorg/c8pjp9bzb8niybiuw50v/235A4755.jpg)\n\n## What do you love most about playing for Proctor's hockey program?\n\nJodie: Proctors hockey program is very special to me and will always hold a special place in my heart. Some days I’ll have a bad day and I can always count on my team to make it better . We have so much grit and determination on our team and it’s truly inspiring. We don’t have as many players like other teams do but we still show up to every game with that determination to win.\n\n![Proctor Academy Athletics](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1705958187/proctoracademyorg/zz31l6khhtxbqvzsnrzc/576A4634.jpg)\n\n## How have you worked to build a supportive team culture that allows you to compete in a very talented, deep prep hockey schedule?\n\nJodi:  I believe it starts off the ice and we do little things like putting our phones away once we step into the locker room before our game, going around the locker room and telling each other our personal and team goals for the game , team breakfast, and even little things like all matching and wearing our team jackets to the game. The chemistry starts off the ice and we have prioritized that the whole season and it carries onto the ice and helps our play.\n\nHunter: It is difficult to win games in this league, every opponent can put pucks in your net in a game played fast and physical.  Keeping emotions in check is key as you learn from mistakes and trust that you are always capable of more. It has shown this year with some tough losses and big wins.  This team is young and excited to play, as coaches we are lucky to have such a positive team ready for the challenges they face. \n\nKate: We have worked to cultivate a supportive culture by committing to focusing on hockey when we touch the ice, holding each other accountable while letting each player be themselves, and caring about team success over individual success.  I love coaching this team because kids want to be there and hear advice, ask the right questions, and support each other. They do all of this while having fun, keeping the environment light, and never taking themselves too seriously. This makes practice and games the part of my day that I look forward to the most.\n\n![Proctor Academy Athletics](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1705958233/proctoracademyorg/wkynliiivm2qkzvfnhvl/235A4897.jpg)\n\n## Looking ahead to the rest of your season, what goals do you have as a team?\n\nJodi: We have gotten better each game and I think just taking what we learn in practice and applying that in the game will continue to help us. A lot of teams underestimate us as a team and that fuels us to beat them. We all know keeping the game simple and just playing how we know how to play is going to be the key to success and having a successful season.\n\nHunter: We look at the game in three zones; offensive, neutral, and defensive. We have seen improvement in all three but still have work to do.  Our goal is to continue to develop our systems and techniques so that we can put together complete games consistently.  All three periods, all three zones. \n\nKate: Our goals for the rest of the season are to beat some of our Lakes Region rivals so we can be ranked top 4 in the league and play for a league title in the Lakes Region tournament.\n\n![Proctor Academy Athletics](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1705958295/proctoracademyorg/vitsgsnxrxniuxxzou1t/235A4847.jpg)\n\n## [Check out other Team Spotlights here!](https://www.proctoracademy.org/explore-proctor/the-buzz?tag_id=22)"

  "text": "Feb 28 2024 12:30 PM \nAs the winter season concludes, we reflect on the past three months and the tireless efforts of coaches, athletic trainers, athletic staff, ski area crew, hockey rink staff, and students. The winter athletic season requires a remarkable amount of energy and commitment, and we are so thankful for all those who made this winter successful. \nWhile the scoreboard was not always in our favor, keeping our eyes set on the lessons taught and relationships developed through sport reminds us why we commit the time, energy, and resources to our athletic programs. Thank you to everyone that made the winter season happen, and to the staff at the Proctor Broadcasting Network for working tirelessly to provide livestreams of all home athletic contests. \nDuring end of season gatherings, teams recognized individual award recipients. Congratulations to the following award winners. \nMarvin Award Winners\nThe Marvin Award is given each season to two students who are new to Proctor for their leadership, sportsmanship, and ability. This winter's Marvin Award recipients are Katie Grady '27 and Scottie Connors '26. Below are words shared by their coaches.\nKatie Grady – Hockey\nNew to the varsity girls' hockey team this season, Katie earned her first start -- and her first win -- against Middlesex School. It was an intense contest, proving not only her ability between the pipes but also revealing her unflappable and unwavering mental focus. She possesses excellent technique and rebound control in the crease. She competes with intensity. Throughout the season, Katie has made the most of every start for the team as her calm demeanor provides a sense of stability and positions teammates for success. Daily, she arrives to practice wearing a smile on her face, underpinned by a desire to improve as a player. Katie has brought positive energy to our team throughout the year and consistently shows up for her teammates.\nScotty Connors – USSS/FIS Skiing\nScotty's positive impact on the U16 team cannot be overstated. His work ethic and athletic ability led him to four podium finishes this season, including two GS victories, establishing him as one of the top U16 skiers in the East. He elevates the level of competition and effort within the group, and his lead-by-example style has pushed his peers to regularly commit their best effort on the hill. \nIt is not only Scotty's speed that propels his teammates but also his attitude. He is committed to ski racing, which is evidenced by the amount of time and care he invests in tuning his skis; listening to and receiving feedback from coaches; and watching film every day -- not just film of himself. He will participate in film sessions that don't even include him skiing. Scotty makes it cool to care, and he has inspired the boys' U16 squad to remain focused throughout the season by contributing to a team culture that rewards hard work. \nBoys Varsity Basketball\nMost Valuable Player – Chris Chol ‘25\nCoaches’ Award – Elijah Torres ‘24\nBoys JV Basketball\nMost Valuable Player – Theo Webster ‘26\nTeammate Award – Myles Saint Louis ‘25\nGirls Varsity Basketball\nCoaches’ Award – Kyara Cruz ‘25\nMost Outstanding Player – Mia Canales ‘25\nGirls JV Basketball\nCoaches’ Award – Indira McIntyre ‘25\nMost Improved Player - Huyên Nguyen \nBoys Varsity Hockey\nCOMING SOON\nBoys JV Hockey\nCoaches’ Award – Joe Neilon ‘27\nMost Improved Player – Patrick Moore ‘25\nGirls Varsity Hockey\nMost Valuable Player – Jodie Gratton ‘24\nCoaches’ Award – Sally Sweeney ‘24\nWright Hockey Award – Viltaute Jasineviciute ‘26\nGirls JV Hockey\nMost Improved Player – Lily Krehbiel ‘25\nLink of the Locker Room – Adelyn Pine ‘25\nAlpine Skiing\nMost Improved Skier – Rose Bertram ‘24\nCoaches’ Award – Rohan Goswami ‘24\nCaptains' Award – Claire Sargent '26\nNordic Skiing\nMost Valuable Skier – Niko Cole-Johnson ‘25, Noah Gardner ‘25\nFreeride\nCoaches’ Award – Lily Zhang ‘24 \nCheck out more articles on Proctor Athletics here!",

We are on the water every day, weather permitting, and use non-water days for conditioning and erg work.\n\nWe train in singles, doubles, quads, fours, and eights. Rowers will be comfortable rowing in scull and sweep boats. We are dedicated to creating versatile and flexible rowers that feel capable in all sorts of boats and line-ups.\n\n   \nRowers are expected to become skilled with rigging and de-rigging boats, moving boats off and on racks, strapping, and coxswain commands. Proctor rowing emphasizes the technical development of each rower, physical conditioning, and a love of rowing. The team embraces the challenge, fun, and commitment that comes with rowing and is always excited for passionate new-comers to the sport. Come join us on the water!"

The team set or broke nine school records in 2023, and at the conclusion of the season, four Proctor athletes competed at the New England Championships where 7th place finishes were realized in both the long jump and intermediate hurdles. Prior to joining Proctor, Tom filled in as a track coach during the winter season at Hanover High, and before that was the sprint & hurdles coach for two seasons at Oliver Ames High in Easton, MA, where he assisted the girls 4x100 relay team break two school records. Tom, a lifelong runner, jumped back into “sprinting” at master events at the age of 50 – and has competed since then at national and international events – winning gold at a national meet in the 4x400 and 3x at the Penn Relays.\nTom graduated from Boston University where he played rugby for three seasons. He had a successful career in banking for over 45 years as a middle market commercial lender, and remains a Corporator at South Shore Bank after retiring 2 years ago. Tom has coached youth soccer, tennis, baseball, and basketball teams and played soccer for 10+ years in adult leagues in New England.\nHead Coach\nCooper is a 10-year veteran of the ski industry with areas of expertise including equipment, sales, technical skills, and coaching. Originally from Landgrove VT, he grew up ski racing through the Bromley Outing Club race program. He attended high school in Waitsfield, VT at GMVS ski academy, where he raced FIS and USSA graduating in 2010. Cooper’s college career started in New London, NH where he continued to race USSA and was a part of the Colby-Sawyer College NCAA Soccer team. He moved to Colorado in 2013 and continued his passion for skiing, before ending up in Crested Butte Colorado where he finished his degree at Western Colorado University and became the head alpine coach for Crested Butte Mountain Sports Team.\nCooper works to create an environment that encourages athletes to learn and develop on and off the hill. He believes that skiing not only builds character and confidence but also gives a sense of accomplishment. Through skiing and the sport of ski racing, he enjoys inspiring a group of individuals to communicate, hold themselves accountable, and instill confidence while providing them the opportunity to pursue their athletic goals. \nWhen Cooper is not skiing or thinking about skiing, he can be found dicing it up at the soccer field at local adult tournaments. Cooper also has a deep passion for white water rafting and will talk your ear off about any dog breed as he religiously watches the Westminster dog show every year. Cooper is pumped to join the Proctor community!\nSelect another Team\nSelect Team",

As a graduate of Proctor, Bartoldus understands the academic demands and athletic rigor of participating as a student-athlete at a boarding school. Coach Bartoldus weighs in on the Proctor Academy athletic model, “Our dual-sport model better prepares student-athletes for the future demands of collegiate sports. It also implements and refines time management skills, aspects of community engagement, and how to compete in a capacity outside of one’s comfort zone.” As a student-athlete at Proctor, Bartoldus was recognized for his athletic capabilities, receiving the following gestures of recognition his senior year: McDonald’s All-American (Nominee), Most Valuable Player (2010), Fred Elroy Emerson 1886 Award (Presented to the student who, during the junior and senior years, has shown the greatest development in attaining the ideals of Proctor), and the Spencer Wright Athletic Award (For athletic achievement and sportsmanship). \nPrior to coaching at Proctor, Bartoldus served as the program director for both Varsity Basketball and Cross Country Running at Cardigan Mountain School. Amidst his brief stint on The Point, Bartoldus led each program to consecutive, successful seasons. \nBartoldus began his professional career at New England College (NCAA DIII), where he served as the lead assistant coach to Charlie Mason. When reflecting on the impact and professionalism of Bartoldus, Mason notes: “Ben is one of the finest men I have ever had the pleasure of working with as a coach… Ben exudes leadership. He demonstrated all the positive qualities that embody college athletics: sportsmanship, work ethic and empathy.”\nAs a collegiate student-athlete, Bartoldus served as a tri-year captain of the Men's Basketball Team at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. During his freshman campaign, Bartoldus led the Judges to a 19-9 record and an ECAC Championship, where he was named Most Valuable Player (avg. 12.3 points on 68.9% FG and 62.5% 3pt). Over the course of his career Bartoldus earned the following accolades: 1,000pt. Club and All-Conference nods each of his four years. Bartoldus received a bachelors in History the spring of 2014.\nBen teaches within the Social Science department at Proctor, exploring the realms of Economics and United States History with Hornet student-athletes.

His enthusiasm for skiing started at a young age as a member of the weekend race program at Mount Sunapee. It wasn’t until he joined the weekday Proctor Junior Ski Team, however, that his enthusiasm for the sport flourished into a lifelong passion. Geoff’s love of the Proctor Ski Hill led to him attending Proctor Academy for four years (2005-2009). During that time, he was a 2x Macomber Cup Champion, U18 Slalom State Champion, NHARA Development Team Member, and 2x NHARA State\nTeam Member. Geoff continued his education and ski racing career at the University of New Hampshire, where he earned a degree in Business Administration and competed as a Wildcat for UNH’s NCAA alpine ski team for 4 years.\nGeoff recently returned to his Proctor roots as a part-time U10/12/14 coach for the Proctor\nJunior Hornet weekend program, where he’s really enjoyed reconnecting with former coaches and competitors. He has been an active race day volunteer at the Ski Hill since graduating from UNH, and is excited to expand his role as a coach and mentor for the U16 USSS athletes.\nAcademic Coordinator\nOriginally from Washington, CT, Kate graduated with a degree in Philosophy from Muhlenberg College. She went on to teach math, writing, and language tutorials at the Greenwood School where she developed her skills and her love of education. \nKate then moved to Andover to work as a learning specialist and dorm parent at Proctor between 2008-2018. She started a family here, and is raising twin boys who hope to be future Hornets themselves someday! Kate left Proctor in 2018 and explored teaching in a variety of different environments including public schools, small private schools, and therapeutic programs. She has since returned to Learning Skills and is thrilled to be back in the incredibly warm Proctor community she loves and believes in so much.\nKate has done graduate coursework on creativity and innovation, educational administration, and special education. She is currently in pursuit of her special education certification in the State of New Hampshire. She is an enthusiastic educator who believes that with the proper support and skill development, students who once struggled will be able to reach their true academic potential and, as Proctor’s motto states, “Live to Learn.”\nKate owns a home nearby in Andover where she lives with her twins, Finn and Leo, her partner, Dan, and their myriad pets. She enjoys singing, crafting, pottery, skiing, and spending time outside enjoying the natural beauty of New Hampshire.\nHead Coach\nCooper is a 10-year veteran of the ski industry with areas of expertise including equipment, sales, technical skills, and coaching. Originally from Landgrove VT, he grew up ski racing through the Bromley Outing Club race program. He attended high school in Waitsfield, VT at GMVS ski academy, where he raced FIS and USSA graduating in 2010. Cooper’s college career started in New London, NH where he continued to race USSA and was a part of the Colby-Sawyer College NCAA Soccer team. He moved to Colorado in 2013 and continued his passion for skiing, before ending up in Crested Butte Colorado where he finished his degree at Western Colorado University and became the head alpine coach for Crested Butte Mountain Sports Team.\nCooper works to create an environment that encourages athletes to learn and develop on and off the hill. He believes that skiing not only builds character and confidence but also gives a sense of accomplishment. Through skiing and the sport of ski racing, he enjoys inspiring a group of individuals to communicate, hold themselves accountable, and instill confidence while providing them the opportunity to pursue their athletic goals. \nWhen Cooper is not skiing or thinking about skiing, he can be found dicing it up at the soccer field at local adult tournaments. Cooper also has a deep passion for white water rafting and will talk your ear off about any dog breed as he religiously watches the Westminster dog show every year. Cooper is pumped to join the Proctor community!\nUSS/FIS Program Director\nA Montana native, Moot grew up skiing and racing at Snowbowl Mountain in Missoula, MT. This is where he developed his strong passion for big mountains and ski racing. He thoroughly enjoyed his time as a speed skier, racing many Downhills on the Western circuit. He went on to college at Montana State University, where he earned his Business Management degree while racing for the MSU Alpine team. While racing for MSU, he was the captain of the team for two years and went on to experience a National Championships in 2000.\nAfter college, Moot coached FIS men/women at Big Sky Ski Education Foundation in Big Sky, MT for 4 years before moving to the east coast with his wife, Abby. He then immediately started coaching U16’s at Sunapee. He joined the Proctor community 15 years ago, when he took on the role as Head FIS/USSS Coach and then a few years later, as the U16 Head Coach. Moot recently transitioned into the Alpine Director role. \nMoot has earned his level 300 coaches certificate and finds the most joy when he is “motivating athletes “ on and off the hill. Moot’s coaching philosophy is to create a fun and positive environment that focuses on the development of becoming the best version of yourself through accountability, hard work, and a positive attitude. Don't be surprised if you see him getting kids pumped up at the start “in all his ways” or bringing a sense of humor and a smile to your day.. \nMoot recently moved to campus with his wife Abby, two children, Ridge (age 12) and Coulee (age 9), and dog Olee (age 2). Moot loves to spend his time recreating with his family, mountain biking, skiing, and enjoying all that the mountains have to offer. He also has a fervor for “all things fishing”, hunting, travel, and grilling.\nCoach\nGrowing up in Colorado inspired Caity’s passion for skiing. Living in Telluride, she spent endless hours in the San Juan mountains. Caity graduated from Telluride High School and raced with Telluride Ski and Snowboard Club. She continued her education and ski racing career at Colby-Sawyer College, competing in the EISA. Caity has coached U12s for Ski and Snowboard Club Vail, and U12s to U16s for the National Alpine Ski Camp (NASC) in the summer months at Mount Hood, Oregon.\nCaity's goal at Proctor is to combine her ski racing experience with her Exercise Science background on and off the hill. Her coaching philosophy is to create a positive team environment, and to increase confidence and determination. Although alpine skiing is an individual sport, Caity believes in accountability and a positive mindset. Support can change an athlete’s mentality in the start gate, as well as in everyday life. \nCaity likes being outdoors, mountain biking, trail running, and paddleboarding. She enjoys ceramics and watching football, and also loves spending time with her family, including her twin sister, younger brother, and cats. Caity is continuing her studies at Colby-Sawyer College, getting a Master’s Degree in Exercise Science.\nSelect another Team\nSelect Team",

This is where he developed his strong passion for big mountains and ski racing. He thoroughly enjoyed his time as a speed skier, racing many Downhills on the Western circuit. He went on to college at Montana State University, where he earned his Business Management degree while racing for the MSU Alpine team. While racing for MSU, he was the captain of the team for two years and went on to experience a National Championships in 2000.\nAfter college, Moot coached FIS men/women at Big Sky Ski Education Foundation in Big Sky, MT for 4 years before moving to the east coast with his wife, Abby. He then immediately started coaching U16’s at Sunapee. He joined the Proctor community 15 years ago, when he took on the role as Head FIS/USSS Coach and then a few years later, as the U16 Head Coach. Moot recently transitioned into the Alpine Director role. \nMoot has earned his level 300 coaches certificate and finds the most joy when he is “motivating athletes “ on and off the hill. Moot’s coaching philosophy is to create a fun and positive environment that focuses on the development of becoming the best version of yourself through accountability, hard work, and a positive attitude. Don't be surprised if you see him getting kids pumped up at the start “in all his ways” or bringing a sense of humor and a smile to your day.. \nMoot recently moved to campus with his wife Abby, two children, Ridge (age 12) and Coulee (age 9), and dog Olee (age 2). Moot loves to spend his time recreating with his family, mountain biking, skiing, and enjoying all that the mountains have to offer.

Deciding it was time to see more of the ski racing world, he spent five winters in Lake Tahoe, CA, where he coached at Sugar Bowl Academy from 2016-2020. \nAfter spending the last two winter seasons away from coaching and being a snowcat operator, he is very excited to get back to Proctor to motivate athletes towards their goals. His coaching philosophy is about keeping it simple and applying the basic fundamentals of skiing immersed in a fun and productive learning environment. \nWhen you see Geordie, he may look familiar, possibly because you have seen him on National Geographic’s show Wicked Tuna! He has been part of the cast since 2012! We’ve got a celebity in the bee hive!\nHead Coach\nJustin serves as the Head Men’s FIS coaching role with the Eastern Alpine program.

He also has a fervor for “all things fishing”, hunting, travel, and grilling.\n    \n\n#### Select another Team\n\nSelect Team"

As a graduate of Proctor, Bartoldus understands the academic demands and athletic rigor of participating as a student-athlete at a boarding school. Coach Bartoldus weighs in on the Proctor Academy athletic model, “Our dual-sport model better prepares student-athletes for the future demands of collegiate sports. It also implements and refines time management skills, aspects of community engagement, and how to compete in a capacity outside of one’s comfort zone.” As a student-athlete at Proctor, Bartoldus was recognized for his athletic capabilities, receiving the following gestures of recognition his senior year: McDonald’s All-American (Nominee), Most Valuable Player (2010), Fred Elroy Emerson 1886 Award (Presented to the student who, during the junior and senior years, has shown the greatest development in attaining the ideals of Proctor), and the Spencer Wright Athletic Award (For athletic achievement and sportsmanship). \nPrior to coaching at Proctor, Bartoldus served as the program director for both Varsity Basketball and Cross Country Running at Cardigan Mountain School. Amidst his brief stint on The Point, Bartoldus led each program to consecutive, successful seasons. \nBartoldus began his professional career at New England College (NCAA DIII), where he served as the lead assistant coach to Charlie Mason. When reflecting on the impact and professionalism of Bartoldus, Mason notes: “Ben is one of the finest men I have ever had the pleasure of working with as a coach… Ben exudes leadership. He demonstrated all the positive qualities that embody college athletics: sportsmanship, work ethic and empathy.”\nAs a collegiate student-athlete, Bartoldus served as a tri-year captain of the Men's Basketball Team at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. During his freshman campaign, Bartoldus led the Judges to a 19-9 record and an ECAC Championship, where he was named Most Valuable Player (avg. 12.3 points on 68.9% FG and 62.5% 3pt). Over the course of his career Bartoldus earned the following accolades: 1,000pt. Club and All-Conference nods each of his four years. Bartoldus received a bachelors in History the spring of 2014.\nBen teaches within the Social Science department at Proctor, exploring the realms of Economics and United States History with Hornet student-athletes. He enjoys cooking, reading, and spending time with his family. Recently, Ben built a cabin in the woods and enjoys occasional getaways with his fiancee, Taela, and their two pups, Maggie & Brady. \nCoach\nFrancheska “Cheka” Ventura PA'13, originally from Lawrence, MA, returns to Proctor Academy after earning both a Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Mathematics and Master of Science degree in Homeland Security at Endicott College. At Endicott, Cheka was a resident assistant and played both basketball and field hockey. As a field hockey goalie, she earned Rookie of the Year honors for the ECAC. She is currently a project manager in construction and lives in Ferguson with her partner, Josie Sanchez.

Marc joined the Proctor community in 2017 while still in college as a Student Teacher working on his Senior Thesis regarding historical role immersion games as an effective teaching method. He returned to Proctor Academy in 2022 after teaching abroad in Ethiopia for the Peace Corps. Marc currently serves as a World History Teacher, Developmental Snowboard Coach, and Assistant Varsity Baseball Coach. Marc lives in Carr House with his Aussiedoodle named Ziggy and enjoys playing baseball, softball, snowboarding, and reading in their free time. \nCoach\nWith over 20 years of snowboard coaching on his resume, Ian Kirk brings a wealth of international experience to the Proctor Freeride Ski and Snowboard Team. His professional immersion in the field has created an inclusive approach to coaching and an extensive web of contacts throughout the sport.\nRaised in Wilmot, New Hampshire, Ian learned to snowboard at King Ridge Resort, a beloved local mountain known for its \"top down\" skiing and riding. After graduating from Kearsarge Regional High School in 1992, he went on to attend Colorado College. While there he manufactured snowboards for Never Summer Snowboards in Denver, and of course, made waves in the upcoming world of snowboarding in the Colorado mountains. After finishing college at University of Vermont with a degree from the School of Natural Resources, Ian began coaching the Okemo Mountain School snowboard team, where he met and coached well known riders such as Kevin Pearce. This led to a full time, eleven year stint at Stratton Mountain School. It was at these academies where his philosophy was developed as he worked with some of today’s top professional riders. \nIn 2014 he founded Kirk’s Camp, a private coaching business with a multi-disciplined approach. The enrollment of international riders resulted in numerous international competitions, experiences, and influences, giving Ian a much bigger scope of the sport. From 2019 to 2023, he was contracted as Head Coach with the Chinese and Hungarian National Teams, and spent much of this time on the World Cup tour training top riders for competition in locations such as Austria, Sweden, Argentina, New Zealand, China, and Japan. \nAfter years of full time travel and life abroad, Ian has now returned home to live in Sunapee, New Hampshire, and enjoys being close to his family while continuing to share his love of snowboarding and skateboarding in his local community. \nHead Coach\nEric joins the Proctor community having been appointed as the coach of the Freeskiing team for the 2023-2024 season. He lives in Wellesley, MA with his wife, Isabel, and their three daughters: Janet (20), Celia (18), and Eliza (15). When on campus, Eric resides in English House.\nA competitor on the World Pro Mogul Tour for nine years (1985-1993) while living in Vail, CO, Scharmer credits all of his life’s achievements as being anchored by the roots of what he learned about himself as a skier, and incorporating that wisdom to all of life’s challenges. A \"two planker\" from the word go, Eric is a skier 24/7/365 because it’s always snowing somewhere.\nIt was a background in underwater archaeology that led Scharmer to a more than three decades career as a freelance director of photography in television and film, having gotten his start in production on underwater documentaries for Discovery Channel. The backbone of Eric’s career as a DP in the greater Boston area was covering the four major pro sports teams for three sports networks from 1996 on: NFL Network, NESN, and NBC Sports Boston. In that time, Scharmer covered twenty teams that went to Championship Series or Super Bowls, securing twelve World Titles.\nAn optimist at his core, Eric has realized more dreams than he’d ever thought possible when he was in high school. He has a background in Broadway theatrical production, along with roles building and striking rock & roll concert sets with IATSE Local 11 Stagehands in Boston. Scharmer is a proud national member of The Explorers Club, belongs to the historic Boston Press Photographers Association, and recently completed his 18th straight Pan Mass Challenge with the Boston Red Sox Team 9. \nSelect another Team\nSelect Team",

Marc joined the Proctor community in 2017 while still in college as a Student Teacher working on his Senior Thesis regarding historical role immersion games as an effective teaching method. He returned to Proctor Academy in 2022 after teaching abroad in Ethiopia for the Peace Corps. Marc currently serves as a World History Teacher, Developmental Snowboard Coach, and Assistant Varsity Baseball Coach. Marc lives in Carr House with his Aussiedoodle named Ziggy and enjoys playing baseball, softball, snowboarding, and reading in their free time. \nCoach\nWith over 20 years of snowboard coaching on his resume, Ian Kirk brings a wealth of international experience to the Proctor Freeride Ski and Snowboard Team. His professional immersion in the field has created an inclusive approach to coaching and an extensive web of contacts throughout the sport.\nRaised in Wilmot, New Hampshire, Ian learned to snowboard at King Ridge Resort, a beloved local mountain known for its \"top down\" skiing and riding. After graduating from Kearsarge Regional High School in 1992, he went on to attend Colorado College. While there he manufactured snowboards for Never Summer Snowboards in Denver, and of course, made waves in the upcoming world of snowboarding in the Colorado mountains. After finishing college at University of Vermont with a degree from the School of Natural Resources, Ian began coaching the Okemo Mountain School snowboard team, where he met and coached well known riders such as Kevin Pearce. This led to a full time, eleven year stint at Stratton Mountain School. It was at these academies where his philosophy was developed as he worked with some of today’s top professional riders. \nIn 2014 he founded Kirk’s Camp, a private coaching business with a multi-disciplined approach. The enrollment of international riders resulted in numerous international competitions, experiences, and influences, giving Ian a much bigger scope of the sport. From 2019 to 2023, he was contracted as Head Coach with the Chinese and Hungarian National Teams, and spent much of this time on the World Cup tour training top riders for competition in locations such as Austria, Sweden, Argentina, New Zealand, China, and Japan. \nAfter years of full time travel and life abroad, Ian has now returned home to live in Sunapee, New Hampshire, and enjoys being close to his family while continuing to share his love of snowboarding and skateboarding in his local community. \nSelect another Team\nSelect Team",

For all athletes, a custom strength and conditioning program is designed and supported. \nEaster Ski athletes have daily access to Proctor’s new fitness center and athletic training facilities. \nTraining Camps and Year Round Program\nThe Eastern Alpine Ski Team goal is to get its athletes on the best possible snow as many times as year as possible. \nThe team offers global ski training experiences throughout the year that align with Proctor’s global educational model with a training trip in August (Chile or Switzerland), mid-Fal (indoor training venues)l, November (Colorado and Panorama, BC), a New Year's Camp with alumni at the Proctor Ski Area providing high volume training, and a June camp at Mount Hood. \nAccessibility of Training\nOpen from early December through late March, the Proctor Ski Area offers more than 100 days of training each season. This facility is a dedicated, elite training venue on campus that offers training priority to the Eastern Alpine Ski Team. \nUse of a Prinoth 350 grooming machine guarantees superb conditions throughout the season. Additionally, newly widened training and racing trails offer fully netted, full length training. \nThe area hosts a variety of USS and regional FIS races, as well as College Carnivals. One veteran coach observes, “The Proctor Ski Area is doing more for snow sports--vertical foot for vertical foot--than any other mountain in New England.

We believe that with the help of a Reunion Committee we could elevate to a level of custom programming that would allow for alumni in their Reunion year to express their ideas about what they and their classmates would like to do with their time on campus. Join us in planning next year’s Reunion! z\nThe Proctor Academy Alumni Association will meet formally once a year. We aim for this meeting to provide Alums with information about what the PAA plans to do in the upcoming year, as well as a time for Alums to ask questions and ultimately get more engaged in the Proctor community.\nWhat's new in your life?\nLet us know! Click HERE to send us your photos and updates that can be included in next year’s magazine! \nConnecting Alumni to Alumni\nMentoring Program \nMentoring relationships are essential for young alumni development. Get involved! \nWe all know that Proctor is a special place. The people you meet at Proctor help shape your life. Through a mentoring program we would like to continue to build and foster these relationships between alumni. Whether you’re an alum looking for professional advice or an alum looking to give back with valuable experience to offer, this program could be for you. The Proctor experience and the sense of community does not have to end after graduation. If you have an interest in being a Mentor, or you’re looking for one, contact us!\nNetworking Receptions\nOur Proctor network is expansive, you should use it!\nA Proctor gathering is always full of good spirits and fun times. We would like to work on expanding these gatherings and adding more professional components to the events. The hope is to begin holding Networking Receptions where Alums are encouraged to talk about their careers with other guests and expand their Proctor professional connections.\nTED Talk Gatherings\nWant to share your ideas with your fellow alumni?\n\nWe’d like to explore the idea of beginning these professional gatherings with a handful of alumni giving a five minute presentation about what they are doing in their professional life and how they got to where they are today. If attending one of these events, or being a starting presenter, sounds like something you might be interested in, please get in touch with us!\nRegional Connections \nIt is a goal of the PAA to find alumni who are interested and willing to be Regional Chairs in support of Regional Chapters. Someone appointed to a Regional Chair would aid in the hosting and planning of events in their area. The Alumni Office would work hand-in-hand with these Chairs and provide them with the data and support necessary to host successful events in your part of the world. Proctor has alumni all over the country, and we would like to dive deeper into developing Regional Chapters of PAA so that Alums can network and get to know other Alums in their regions beyond when Proctor itself hosts events in the city/area.\nReconnecting with Life on Campus\nGuest Lecturing\nShare your expertise with our students by visiting classes. If you’re doing something interesting, exciting or would just like to give back to Proctor, consider returning to campus and being a visitor to one of Proctor’s classes. \nProject Period \nProctor provides its students with unique and valuable experiences during Project Period every March. It's the opportunity for them to learn a new skill, explore something they’ve never done or find a new passion. If you have any ideas for Project Period or would like to host/help with an activity, let us know!\nSenior Project \nWhile not all students choose to participate in and create a Senior Project, we think it could be valuable if current students had access to Alum information and could reach out to Alums in industries or fields that interested them.

  "text": "Q: What is the purpose of my I-20 form?\nEvery non-U.S. citizen needs this form to acquire a student visa; the student visa allows you to attend Proctor Academy. Your student visa must apply for at least your first year at Proctor Academy. In addition, you need the I-20 form whenever you travel, both within the U.S. borders and especially when you leave the U.S. This form and your VISA are your legal documents from the U.S. Immigration Department and should be kept safe and secure at all times. It is suggested that these items be given to the International Student Coordinator for safekeeping when not traveling.\nQ: What is Wilderness Orientation?\nFor over 40 years, all new Proctor students have backpacked through the White Mountains for 5 days prior to starting classes. Thousands of Proctor alumni will tell you that Orientation is an experience they will never forget! For many students, this trip is their first time hiking in the woods. It is an easy hike so please do not be nervous about Orientation! Please visit our Wilderness Orientation page to review what you’ll need for Orientation.\nQ: What about health insurance and medical services?\nProctor operates its own health center which is staffed by a medical director and school physician. If you do not have health insurance that covers your student while they study in the U.S., you are required to have an insurance coverage plan offered through Proctor. All Enrollment Forms can be found on our Enrollment Essentials page. \nQ: How do I plan my travel?\nPlease review the Proctor Academy calendar. You should plan your flights carefully so you do not miss any school commitments. We do understand that there will be times when the logistics of flights and travel times will be in conflict with the school calendar. Please communicate any conflicts with the International Student Coordinator as early as possible. \nQ: What clothing should I bring to school?\nThe weather in New Hampshire can be very unpredictable. During the Fall, it can be 80°s (25° Celsius) one day and 40° (5° Celsius) the next. Warm clothes are definitely needed for the winter: coat, hat, gloves, boots, etc. Our dress code is informal, so plan to bring items that are practical for the weather and comfortable for you. Dressier clothes (dresses, sport coats, ties, etc.) are only needed occasionally. If you have questions about clothing, you can wait until you arrive on campus, as there will be opportunities to shop during the school year.\nQ: Cell Phone coverage?\nOnly Verizon and US Cellular have good coverage in our area. You can either take out a contract with one of these companies or get a “Pre-Paid” phone with a separate card for international calls. We have had great results using Tracfone. For safety while traveling, we strongly urge our international students to have a cell phone in the United States with coverage at Proctor Academy.\nQ: Spending Money?\nBar Harbor Bank is located across from our main campus and has ATM (Cash machine) services that link to most major banking systems. Most international students have Visa or Mastercard Debit/Credit cards for purchases. We strongly discourage students from keeping large amounts of cash in their rooms.\nQ: May I leave campus for an overnight or on the weekends?\nThe International Student Coordinator will act as your “in loco parentis” for travel purposes once the Travel Permission (available for review on your myProctor account in the summer) is signed by your parents/guardians. The sign-out process is outlined in the Student Handbook.",

  "text": "Philosophy and Purpose\nIt is the goal of Proctor Academy’s Admissions Office to enroll a talented, motivated, passionate and diverse student body. The financial aid program supports deserving students who are unable to afford a Proctor education without financial assistance. Financial aid is need-based.\nThe Financial Aid Process\nAdmissions and financial aid are separate processes. Admissions decisions are never based upon a family’s ability to pay. Once a student is admitted, the Financial Aid Committee determines whether the school will be able to meet the need of the family. Need is defined as the difference between a family’s discretionary resources and the cost of educating the student. Although the school grants $4,000,000 in financial aid to approximately 35% of the student body, we are unable to offer financial aid to every qualified applicant. Therefore, some students will be admitted to Proctor without financial aid. Financial aid decisions are made in conjunction with the March 10th Admissions notification date.\nDetermination of Awards\nProctor’s need-based financial assistance program is guided by the National Association of Independent Schools’ “Principles of Good Practice for Financial Aid Administration.” Clarity uses a family’s financial information and applies it to a formula to estimate what a family can contribute towards the cost of education. The financial aid committee makes a final determination taking into account Clarity’s estimate and each family’s resources and individual circumstances. Families should identify all possible resources for funding a Proctor education before seeking financial assistance from the school.\nHow to Apply\nTo get started, please go to the Clarity Application and create an account. The application typically takes less than 30 minutes to complete, and it is mobile-friendly so you can complete it from anywhere. You are able to save your progress and return at any time. At the end of the application, there is a $60 fee* to submit, and you can share your application with additional schools that accept the Clarity Application for no additional charge. Simply use the dropdown menu in the application to select those schools. \nThe deadline for completing the financial aid application is February 1, 2024. \nIf you need support during the process of completing your application, there is in-app support available as well as email support at support@claritytuition.com in both English and Spanish. The application itself is also fully translated into Spanish. \n*Fee waivers are automatically granted by Clarity after completion of the application if the financial information you submitted indicates that you qualify for a waiver.\nTips For Completing the Financial Aid Application\nClarity Family Application Guide\nAdmissions\nContact Us\nFINANCIAL AID FAQS:\nHow is financial aid determined? \nWhere does financial aid come from? \nWill applying for financial aid affect my child’s admission? \nWhen is the financial aid application deadline? \nWhen will I receive notification of my financial aid award? \nWill my financial aid award change from year to year? \nAre the financial aid records confidential? \nIs financial aid available for international students? \nWhat if parents are divorced or separated? \nAre there payment plans available? \nWhat does financial aid cover, should I expect other fees? \nWhat if we do not need Financial Aid in our first year, but we do in subsequent years? \nWhat is financial aid and how is it different from loans? \nHow is financial aid determined?\nThe Financial Aid Committee makes a determination using Clarity’s methodology, which considers each family’s resources and individual circumstances.\nWhere does financial aid come from?\nEach year, Proctor’s Board of Trustees establishes a financial aid budget, which currently represents 17% of Proctor Academy’s operating budget. Proctor is committed to a comprehensive financial aid program, which exists to attract and allow for a broad selection of students to be a part of our community.\nWill applying for financial aid affect my child’s admission?\nNo, financial aid determination is separate from the Admissions decision.\nWhen is the financial aid application deadline?\nWhen will I receive notification of my financial aid award?\nFor new families, you will receive your financial aid award in conjunction with your Admissions decision on March 10th. For returning families, you will receive your financial aid award in mid-February.\nWill my financial aid award change from year to year?\nFamilies can expect awards to be renewed at the original level of funding from year to year, provided there is no significant change in financial circumstances and that the student remains in good academic and social standing. Proctor requires families to complete a new financial aid application each year. Failure to comply could result in a loss of financial assistance.\nAre the financial aid records confidential?\nAll financial aid information is strictly confidential and viewed only by the Financial Aid Committee and Proctor’s Business Manager.\nIs financial aid available for international students?\nProctor does offer financial aid to international students. International families can complete an application using Clarity here. We also ask that they submit appropriate government documents verifying a family’s stated income and assets.\nWhat if parents are divorced or separated?\nThe Financial Aid Committee considers the financial resources of both parents regardless of current marital status. Proctor is not bound by the assertion that one parent is not responsible for educational expenses due to court order, separation, or divorce. Both parents must submit a financial aid application, and financial documentation is required from all family members, both parents and step-parents. Failure to comply with this request may result in a denial of financial aid or a reduced award.\nAre there payment plans available?\nYes, we offer four payment plans through our billing service “FACTS”\nWhat does financial aid cover, should I expect other fees?\nFinancial Aid awards account for costs associated with tuition and room and board. Incidentals such as travel to and from school, school and dorm supplies, and spending money are generally not covered by financial aid. See Additional Fees for details.\nWhat if we do not need Financial Aid in our first year, but we do in subsequent years?\nIf you enroll your child at Proctor without receiving financial aid, it is unlikely you will receive it in subsequent years. However, we understand that unforeseen changes may significantly impact your ability to meet tuition obligations, and in those situations we ask for a returning family to reach out to the Director of Financial Aid and to complete a financial aid application by February 1st.\nWhat is financial aid and how is it different from loans?\nFinancial aid is a need-based award given to qualifying families to offset the cost of a Proctor education. Unlike a loan, which requires repayment, an award does not have to be repaid.",

Through the culmination of the performance of Lost Girl, the Ocean Classroom Symposium, Proctor/Holderness Day, last evening’s Fall Term Art Show and Instrumental, Dance, and Vocal Performances, and the hard work of students during tonight’s Innovation Night, we witnessed our students showcasing the fruits of their labor before the whole community. \nAs students and faculty streamed from the Brown Dining Commons to the Wilkins Meeting House on Monday evening, so much energy filled the space. Metalwork, woodwork, paintings, textiles, ceramics, digital art, and metal sculptures covered the walls and tables throughout the building. Hundreds of students had work on display, each piece representing an individual learning journey, dozens, sometimes hundreds, of hours of experimentation, failure, and adjustments before a final product was put forth for community viewing. \nA similar artistic learning process unfolded on the stage of the Norris Family Theater moments later as the vocal, instrumental, and dance groups performed. We talk often about the role risk-taking plays in the learning process for adolescents, and nowhere is that process more visible than in the performing arts. One culminating show for the term, hundreds of eyes watching the stage, no place to hide, and yet this is where we see the beauty of an authentic learning process with our students - both for those performing and those observing. \nThe same goal of publicly displaying growth and learning sits at the heart of our annual Innovation Night held to end the fall and spring trimesters. On Tuesday evening, students in Culture and Conflict, Engineering, and Social Entrepreneurship shared a window into the inquiry process by presenting culminating projects in the Farrell Field House. Faculty, staff, parents, and students circulated throughout the lobbies and classrooms as students shared their research, discussed the design thinking process required in their robot design, and presented business plans. \nThrough both the artistic and academic work on display, we were reminded that the process of learning relies on a shared understanding that every individual is very much a work in progress. We are all at different stages of development, all seeking to become better versions of ourselves, and when our peers rally around us to help us in our journey, we know real learning and real growth are possible. Our students hopefully felt this collective support over the past week. \nThank you to all of our students for allowing us to join alongside them in their learning journey, and to our faculty for helping pull out the best in each of our students.\nCheck out more photos of End of Term Arts Here!",

  "text": "Early in his career former Proctor Academy Head of School Lyle Farrell (1952-1971) worked alongside Dr. Samuel T. Orton to pioneer the psychometrics and pedagogy of reading disabilities. Farrell would take what he learned from Orton and establish the nation's leading tutorial support system for college-bound, dyslexic students in the early 1950s at Proctor Academy. Through intentional programming aimed at helping young dyslexic boys, the predecessor to Proctor’s Learning Skills program changed countless young people’s lives.\nFast forward sixty years and Proctor’s Learning Skills program has evolved into a national leader in integrated academic support and sits at the heart of the Proctor experience. Behind each Learning Skills “success” story is a Learning Specialist who dedicates their professional life to supporting, advocating for, and empowering that student to embrace challenges and push themselves beyond what they thought possible. Today, we shine a spotlight on the talented Learning Specialists who tirelessly support our students in Learning Skills. Learn more about Proctor’s Learning Skills Program HERE and meet our Learning Specialists in the profile below. \nProctor's Learning Skills Department (2022-2023): Back (L-R): Kayden Will, Michael Littman, Kate Jones, Raz Rasweiller, Jennifer Fletcher, Linda Sargent, Lauren Cole-Johnson, Kristen Nesbitt (Departed Proctor); Front (L-R): Lynn Cox, Joan Saunders, Lori Patriacca (now Dean of Faculty Development), Wendy McLeod, Annie MacKenzie, Casey McCormick, Anna-Marie Hanlon, Karine Dumont. New Members 2023-2024 not pictured: Laurel Shinerock and Ashley Barsanti. \nJennifer Fletcher (Learning Skills Department Chair) \nHow long have you been at Proctor? \n26 years \nWhat is one fun fact or hidden talent that you have? \nI enjoy baking and especially love to make homemade cinnamon buns for my family and friends during the holidays. \nIf you could take part in ONE of Proctor's Off-Campus Programs or take ONE class at Proctor, what would it be? \nI would love to participate in the Proctor en Segovia program. \nWhat is one aspect of Learning Skills, or Proctor's Learning Skills students, that you think everyone at Proctor should know more about? \nWhile we obviously work on a wide variety of academic skills and strategies with our students, we also take great care to appreciate our students' strengths and support our students in a holistic way which also includes understanding the social-emotional landscape of teenagers in our setting. In addition, the whole Learning Skills Team is highly collaborative and invested in continuing to grow our own brains and skill sets through the pursuit of both formal and informal professional development opportunities. We are intellectually curious and dedicated to the pursuit of lifelong learning. \nLynn Cox \nHow long have you been at Proctor? \nAround 30 years, except for a two year stint at a nearby college. \nWhat is one fun fact or hidden talent that you have? \nI sang professionally for one year long, long ago and continue to sing in choruses today. \nIf you could take part in ONE of Proctor's Off-Campus Programs or take ONE class at Proctor, what would it be? \nI'd love to go on Proctor en Segovia to see the castle on the hill. \nWhat is one aspect of Learning Skills, or Proctor's Learning Skills students, that you think everyone at Proctor should know more about? \nThe joy that comes with working so closely with students, and helping them to learn how to be their best. \nRaz Rasweiller \nHow long have you been at Proctor? \n25 years \nWhat is one fun fact or hidden talent that you have? \nI’m a Reiki Master. \nIf you could take part in ONE of Proctor's Off-Campus Programs or take ONE class at Proctor, what would it be? \nIf I could take one class at Proctor it would be Math III with Lindsay Brown. I visit her classes to do student observations, and every time I leave I say to myself \"I wish I could have LB as my math teacher.\" Her knowledge and overwhelming love of math is quite something! \nWhat is one aspect of Learning Skills, or Proctor's Learning Skills students, that you think everyone at Proctor should know more about? \nCan I cheat and give you two? One is that Jen Fletcher is gifted in her ability to meet a student on an admissions tour, or read their file and then be able pair them with the perfect Learning Specialist. She is an outstanding leader and also a fierce advocate for kids who need our assistance. Secondly, working with my students day after day reminds me that even when things are tough, with the right amount of support, we can all overcome any obstacle.

  "markdown": "Early in his career former Proctor Academy Head of School Lyle Farrell (1952-1971) worked alongside [Dr. Samuel T. Orton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Orton) to pioneer the psychometrics and pedagogy of reading disabilities. Farrell would take what he learned from Orton and establish the nation's leading tutorial support system for college-bound, dyslexic students in the early 1950s at Proctor Academy. Through intentional programming aimed at helping young dyslexic boys, the predecessor to Proctor’s Learning Skills program changed countless young people’s lives.\n\nFast forward sixty years and Proctor’s Learning Skills program has evolved into a national leader in integrated academic support and sits at the heart of the Proctor experience. Behind each Learning Skills “success” story is a Learning Specialist who dedicates their professional life to supporting, advocating for, and empowering that student to embrace challenges and push themselves beyond what they thought possible. Today, we shine a spotlight on the talented Learning Specialists who tirelessly support our students in Learning Skills.

  "text": "In the early 1970s, Proctor’s leadership and faculty made an intentional statement that, despite an incredibly diverse learning population within the school, world languages were something that each and every student could learn. For the past fifty years, this fundamental belief in language acquisition as an attainable goal for all students has guided the development of off-campus language immersion experiences (Proctor en Segovia, Proctor en Monteverde, and European Art Classroom) and the adoption of a world language curriculum that emphasizes acquisition and application rather than fluency. \nIn the video above, World Language Department Chair Kara Jacobs explains Proctor’s approach to world languages, and this deep commitment to helping every student acquire new languages during their time at Proctor. \nRead more about the amazing group of educators who steward the World Language Department and inspire our students to go out into the world in pursuit of new cultural and language experiences! \nHow long have you been at Proctor?\nKara Jacobs (Spanish, World Language Department Chair) | 6 months \nErik Cole-Johnson (Spanish/French) | 29 years \nScott King (Spanish) | 16 years \nMikaela Buldoc-Graumann (Spanish) | 15 years \nSarah Daney (French) - 10 years \nZhen Lei (Spanish/Mandarin) | 2 years \nWhat is your favorite part of your working in the World Language Department at Proctor?\nKara: Seeing our learners acquire the language, learn about the Spanish speaking world and feel successful.\nErik: I love the excitement around new ideas, new methods of teaching and our striving to improve our own understanding of how language acquisition works and how we can best help our students learn language while also talking about both their own lives as well as important issues in our world. We get to talk about literature, art, science, history, everything! My colleagues inspire me every day. They are amazing!\nScott: When students get excited about Spanish and push themselves to learn as much as they can.\nMikaela: I love working alongside my incredible colleagues in the department. We have the freedom to skip the usual textbooks and workbooks, allowing us to team up and create courses that are interesting both for our students and ourselves. Looking for compelling stories and films from the Spanish speaking world to share with my students is one of my favorite parts of designing curriculum. I also appreciate the opportunity to get to know my students better through discussions in the target language!\nSarah: My colleagues and the students - lot's of fun.\nZhen: We have a great working environment here. Everyone is very kind and always offer help, support whenever I need. Also I have a great space to create activities, field trips for our Mandarin program, and always receive 100% support. It makes me feel I am as important as any other member in the department.\nIf you could take part in ONE of Proctor's Off-Campus Programs or take ONE class at Proctor, what would it be?\nKara: I would go to Costa Rica and I would take Culture and Conflict. \nErik: Mountain Classroom would be the program for me. Place based learning and adventure with peers sounds amazing. Something about it just seems so essential, invigorating and, hopefully for participants, inspiring.\nScott: Segovia\nMikaela: I was a Co-Director of the Proctor en Segovia program for many years, and I love going back to Segovia, Spain as often as I can. If I had the opportunity to participate in another program, it would be Mountain Classroom!\nSarah: Segovia - I love language and want to learn Spanish. \nZhen: Segovia, definitely! \nWhat amazes you/makes you proud of being a part of the Proctor community?\nKara: That we don't give language waivers because everyone can learn a language.\nErik: I am proud of being part of a community that accepts and even celebrates its members' quirks and idiosyncrasies. We work to better each other and ourselves, and also know when not to take ourselves too seriously. I love being part of a place that strives to promote the idea of possibility and opening doors and I'm proud of our students who bring compassion to others, are gracious to the adults and peers in the community and try new things and take advantage of the wonderful opportunity Proctor affords.\nScott: The power of an off-campus program like Ocean Classroom in the life of a student. \nMikaela: While interviewing at different schools, one thing that struck me about Proctor was that people were both incredibly passionate about their work and determined to have a decent work/life balance. Proctor faculty and staff seemed genuinely happy. That's one reason I came here years ago, and it's something I've valued ever since!\nSarah: I'm amazed by the supportive, tight-knit community. I'm proud to be teaching the students who are special kids - kind and fun to work with. \nZhen: As a freshman faculty, I feel very welcomed and cared for by the community. \nWhat is one fun fact or hidden talent that you have?\nKara: I have run seven marathons.\nErik: I have been working on a handstand for 16 months. I can't do one and hold it on command yet, but if you see me crumpled on the floor in some hallway, the gym, the classroom or my office, chances are it is due to this quest (still check on me though, just in case!).\nScott: I can demonstrate the proper use of the subjunctive mood in two languages.\nMikaela: I speak 3 languages fluently and am continuing to learn more!\nSarah: I also speak Norwegian!\nZhen: I don't really know:)\nLearn more about Proctor’s Off-Campus Immersion Programs!",

It makes me feel I am as important as any other member in the department.\n\n![Proctor Academy World Language Department](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1707154751/proctoracademyorg/qccip4v4kcfbj0jdgx9c/235A8462.jpg)\n\n## If you could take part in ONE of Proctor's Off-Campus Programs or take ONE class at Proctor, what would it be?\n\nKara: I would go to Costa Rica and I would take Culture and Conflict. \n\nErik: Mountain Classroom would be the program for me. Place based learning and adventure with peers sounds amazing. Something about it just seems so essential, invigorating and, hopefully for participants, inspiring.\n\nScott: Segovia\n\nMikaela: I was a Co-Director of the Proctor en Segovia program for many years, and I love going back to Segovia, Spain as often as I can. If I had the opportunity to participate in another program, it would be Mountain Classroom!\n\nSarah: Segovia - I love language and want to learn Spanish. \n\nZhen: Segovia, definitely! \n\n![Proctor Academy World Language Department](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1707154773/proctoracademyorg/masaenadkthphssgzqc6/235A2278.jpg)\n\n## What amazes you/makes you proud of being a part of the Proctor community?\n\nKara: That we don't give language waivers because everyone can learn a language.\n\nErik: I am proud of being part of a community that accepts and even celebrates its members' quirks and idiosyncrasies. We work to better each other and ourselves, and also know when not to take ourselves too seriously. I love being part of a place that strives to promote the idea of possibility and opening doors and I'm proud of our students who bring compassion to others, are gracious to the adults and peers in the community and try new things and take advantage of the wonderful opportunity Proctor affords.\n\nScott: The power of an off-campus program like Ocean Classroom in the life of a student. \n\nMikaela: While interviewing at different schools, one thing that struck me about Proctor was that people were both incredibly passionate about their work and determined to have a decent work/life balance. Proctor faculty and staff seemed genuinely happy. That's one reason I came here years ago, and it's something I've valued ever since!\n\nSarah: I'm amazed by the supportive, tight-knit community. I'm proud to be teaching the students who are special kids - kind and fun to work with. \n\nZhen: As a freshman faculty, I feel very welcomed and cared for by the community. \n\n## What is one fun fact or hidden talent that you have?\n\nKara: I have run seven marathons.\n\nErik: I have been working on a handstand for 16 months. I can't do one and hold it on command yet, but if you see me crumpled on the floor in some hallway, the gym, the classroom or my office, chances are it is due to this quest (still check on me though, just in case!).\n\nScott: I can demonstrate the proper use of the subjunctive mood in two languages.\n\nMikaela: I speak 3 languages fluently and am continuing to learn more!\n\nSarah: I also speak Norwegian!\n\nZhen: I don't really know:)\n\n## [Learn more about Proctor’s Off-Campus Immersion Programs!](https://www.proctoracademy.org/fs/pages/370)"

  "text": "Jan 26 2024 8:00 AM \nIn the boarding school world, we hear often the impact on institutions of being a generalist, of embracing different pursuits and being well-rounded individuals, of being the traditional triple-threat that can teach, coach, and commit themselves to the residential life experience of our schools. Yet, in the “real world”, specialists are rewarded for being the best at what they do. Children are encouraged from a young age to specialize, despite college coaches claiming they want multi-sport athletes. The mixed messages our children receive as they discover who they are and what passions live within them are not only unhealthy, but have created an unsustainable environment for our schools. \nNPR’s Planet Money ran a short segment a few years ago on this struggle of specialist versus generalist after Novak Djokavich defeated Roger Federer in an epic Wimbledon final. Djokavich specialized from the age of 4. He acknowledged he had one mission in life: to become #1. He never had the opportunity to embrace the “Which Path Will You Choose?” question we ask our students as they enroll at Proctor. Federer, on the other hand, was raised playing soccer, basketball, badminton, and tennis, his mother insisting he not specialize until he was much older. \nDavid Epstein's book, Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World, explores the notion that professional success is the product of generalization and the cross-pollination of experiences across many disciplines, not specialization. Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers argued the opposite. The two, Epstein and Gladwell, got together to discuss the future of the modern athlete at the MIT Sloan School of Business Sports Analytics Conference and the conversation is worth listening to if you have ever wondered how much your child should specialize. \nEpstein’s research shows that most elite athletes go on to specialize at a later age, surpassing their specialized peers over time. But the specialization stories are sexy. We are obsessed with precocity: the videos of Tiger Woods swinging a golf club at age 2, the Suzuki method in music, the four year old who can read fluently. The moment our children can stand, we introduce a racket, a hoop, club, or an instrument in their hand. We urge them to develop and humble-brag about how advanced they are. What we don’t hear with the same enthusiasm are the stories of burnout, the children who walk away from their “passion” because the pressure is too great or the expectations unrealistic. Silent are the stories of parents who have gone into debt to help their child unsuccessfully specialize.\nAt Proctor we believe in generalization, in Epstein’s concept of range, and yet we continually encounter specialization as we seek to offer breadth and depth of opportunity in equal proportions. Our entire educational model is designed to expose students to new opportunities: art classes, sports, off-campus programs, academic courses. At the same time, we want to provide opportunities for students to dive deep into their passions when appropriate. \nOver the past decade, we’ve seen this tension between generalization and specialization grow. Students want to play club sports out of season. Talented artists want to develop their talent all three terms. A demand for specialized coaches and instructors across all academic and non-academic programs threatens the small boarding school model of talented faculty whose professional experiences trend toward range instead of specialization. The pursuit of passions is a good thing, but we must never allow our focus on one passion to stand in the way of our discovery of another. \nPerhaps the societal pendulum of specialization has reached its pinnacle and will soon swing back toward generalization. Maybe we have to ride the upswing a bit longer, but regardless of how society will reward specialization in the future, in our own little sphere of influence, we must continue to articulate the value of generalization among adolescents. We must continue to share stories of students expanding their identity during their high school years. We must empower our students to share with their peers the value of studying off-campus, trying a new sport or afternoon activity, stepping outside their comfort zone of their specialized endeavors and risking failure. The range of experiences available at Proctor is the single greatest opportunity we provide our students. Don’t miss out on it! \nRead more about Proctor's educational model HERE!",

  "text": "I look around Proctor thinking about all of the things we heap upon our already very full plates. It’s like a buffet in Old Las Vegas, piled high with things that on the surface look good but may not always go well together. Egg rolls and steak. Lobster bisque and cheese pizza. Roasted Brussel sprouts and sushi. \nListen to an audio version of this blog HERE! \nOur students do the same thing with their own intensely busy lives. Our students race from ski practice to PEA (Proctor Environmental Action club); helping with math first aid and open recording studio; and a basketball game to an affinity group meeting. All of what we do is designed to be about believing in the power of framing, and how we choose to accept the many kinds of options that are placed in front of us.\nAs our Assistant Head of School Alisa Barnard pointed out last fall, we see “community” as a verb here. That means we must make active and affirmative choices to stay in community, linking the talent of individuals to the power that comes with leaning into and living in the larger group – the community. The joy of being “in community” is what drives us. Whether it’s packing the Ted for a hockey game or the Wilkins Meeting House for a play, we have examples every day and come to see how the individuals at Proctor are interpreting the idea of choice in community works.\nAt Proctor, maybe it is a trick of the brain that compels students to know that getting to do something as opposed to having to do a task or obligation is always the strongest choice. I would argue it’s not just the attractive thing that students are choosing to do, like going to a game or a play to support their friends, but it is also the mundane things that get elevated.\nFor instance, many of our students who desire to get their work done and to be surrounded by other students when they study at night, head over to the Lovejoy Library, even though they may not be compelled to do so, especially as they mature as learners. Many students feel that being in an environment where other students are, for the most part, focused and getting down to business makes them more productive. As the clock clicks close to 7:30 PM, from Sunday to Friday night, you see students queue up to the library’s front desk to take their number from a veteran teacher, and then amble over to their assigned seat to start their work for the evening. This ritual builds a habit that over time becomes its own powerful internal motivation – have to leading to get to.\nI’ll often ask students “sotto voce,” “Hey, what’re you working on.” They’ll point to Trevor Noah’s Born a Crime or a math problem on their screen as if to say, ‘Don’t you see, I’m about to climb Mount Everest. Wish me luck!’ \nIt’s like anything they do, being in community altogether makes it work better. Students come to understand that when they choose to engage, they tend to find greater satisfaction in their lives, and in turn, like a virtuous circle, that choice equals more satisfaction and better results. Some might argue that too much choice has the opposite effect on a student. Instead of propelling them forward, it stops or stymies their progress.\nPerhaps that is true at times, but for the most part, I would argue, getting to “want to” do their homework or go to bed at a reasonable hour makes them able to build resilience and confidence in themselves and in the work they do. Even some of our students who have been shattered by other academic programs before they arrived at Proctor come to find themselves better able to trust the process, especially when they choose for themselves.\nBeing in community and wanting to do right by it is also one of the highest motivating factors of the Proctor model and one of the greatest motivating factors that drives us as a community. The best and most illustrative example is dish duty. Dish duty may be one of the most joyful endeavors that a student within the confines of their shared lived experience that a student and their advisor does at Proctor. Dish duty, a “have to” that for many students, becomes a “get to” over time. Seeing what comes back after it is mostly ingested is not a pretty sight. \nYet, the act of an advisory group being all together, of helping out, turns obligation into something more important. It elevates choosing. It makes our lives feel all the more livable in community when we tell ourselves, “Yes, this is what I get to do because these people, these humans right here in this tiny room, or the ones putting out the clean plates that I have washed, matter more to me that any other humans in the world right now.” \nBrian W. Thomas, Proctor Academy Head of School \nCurated Listening:\nWhat does choice look like in song form? I had to Google the name of the group from the mid-1960s, which was stuck in an open loop in my brain. The Loving Spoonfuls (yes, that is the name of a band) sang “Did You Ever Have to Make up Your Mind?.” Listen: HERE.",

It makes our lives feel all the more livable in community when we tell ourselves, “Yes, this is what I get to do because these people, these humans right here in this tiny room, or the ones putting out the clean plates that I have washed, matter more to me that any other humans in the world right now.” \n\n![Brian_Thomas_Signature_firstonly](https://blogs.proctoracademy.org/hs-fs/hubfs/Brian_Thomas_Signature_firstonly.png?width=98&name=Brian_Thomas_Signature_firstonly.png)\n\nBrian W. Thomas, Proctor Academy Head of School \n\n## Curated Listening:\n\nWhat does choice look like in song form? I had to Google the name of the group from the mid-1960s, which was stuck in an open loop in my brain. The Loving Spoonfuls (yes, that is the name of a band) sang “Did You Ever Have to Make up Your Mind?.” Listen: [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRhp0fbIPLU)."

  "text": "Dec 15 2023 8:00 AM \nThe week before break begins and all through the school, so much was happening, it was hard to know what to do.\nYou all know the lines from “The Night Before Christmas,” yet as we begin to power down this part of the school year for a much needed and well-deserved time away, I am thinking about these last few weeks of the calendar year, which marks the beginning of the end for some of the seniors and many of my colleagues who will be retiring after long and distinguished careers at Proctor. At the same time, it is only just the beginning for the ninth graders who are starting to get their groove on with being high schoolers. Everyone and every story shifts. The thing we all have in common at this time – the end of the calendar year – is all about reflections and fresh beginnings.\nListen to the audio version of Brian's blog here. \nFor our seniors, by now, or at least a week from now, all of the college applications will be done. In fact, some seniors may even be done with the whole process because they have applied Early Decision and they know for certain where they will land. This time for all of our seniors is bittersweet. The long goodbyes begin. It’s not just celebrating their successes, the time for that will come. For many of our oldest students, they are beginning to get their mind around what are all of the things they could or should have done. Certainly, the worry about college selection can now be channeled into thinking about something more animating, like what Senior Project or final classes they might want to take or do? Is there another art class that might be available for them in the third trimester perhaps after not taking many? Or, maybe a member of the Class of 2024 has never participated in a polar swim at Elbow Pond. For that person, this may be a great time to do just that. Maybe a student hasn’t been in one of the amazing theater productions. Now, they can do one or at least consider doing one? There is still time to do something that would astound even them. In the same vein, maybe the opportunity to do a small group hike, along with a solo night in the White Mountains would be in order, too. Three of our seniors from last year did just that on their way out.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the freshmen are beginning to understand what it’s like to have their own space at Proctor. This past week, the freshmen held a Moth Story Hour in the Stone Chapel. Just like the public radio version, the Moth stories are true stories, told in front of a live audience, without notes. Some of the stories were moving beyond belief. Daniel ‘27 told of his mother running the Boston Marathon in 2013 when the bombing happened. He gathered up the strength and courage to remember that day when two loud booms rattled his family's world, police running in the direction of the two blasts, and the chaos that ensued while many people ran for cover or home, and he, his dad, and older brother went searching for his mom, heading towards the chaos like the first responders. Luckily, their mom was safe and they were all reunited. Yet, the rite of passage that Daniel provided us, through the lens of his five year old self, was quite harrowing. Like many Moth Stories, his reflection ended with a tale of triumph not just because his mom ran the most memorable Boston Marathon ever, but that he and his family had the opportunity to go back to Boston and Fenway Park a few weeks later to see David Ortiz proclaim Boston’s true strength and grit before the game. In fact, every one of the seven ninth grade storytellers not only gave us a bit of their history and backstory from their short lives, but they also became expert listeners in the audience. If you could look under the hoods of their rapidly expanding brains, you might just see the Class of 2027 begin to connect the dots at year’s end so that they can make even more memories and synaptic connections. The brain science of becoming better people and even better friends because now they each know each other just a little better.\nThe stories that happen between the four years that a person is in high school, or even between the Class of 2024 and the Class of 2027, is one of diving in, of hope, of amazing oneself, of being more sure of oneself and less certain that you know it all.

  "text": "Nov 27 2023 8:30 AM \nEach trimester brings with it transition -- changes in the weather, new classes, new teams and afternoon programs. Life at Proctor involves more transition than most schools as we welcome back more 40 students from off-campus programs and say goodbye to nearly 40 students embarking on a life-changing experience abroad during the winter months. \nThese transitions create an added layer of community development, but having almost 20% of our student body transitioning between on campus and off each term breathes vitality into every corner of Proctor’s campus.\nIn many high school social structures, peer groups remain relatively static over the course of the year, but that is simply not the case at Proctor. Sure, if you stop any student returning from Proctor en Segovia, European Art Classroom, or Ocean Classroom on their way to assembly and ask about their experience this fall, you will likely be regaled with stories about their host family, excursions across Europe, hiking in Segovia, stepping off the SSV Corwith Cramer onto Bermudian soil, watching the sun set, and then rise again with their C Watch partners. Proctor’s off-campus programs create unique bonds within groups of students that last a lifetime, but these relationships do not operate solely within the isolation of that peer group, but instead serve as a catalyst for new relationships to develop across campus along with the other natural social transitions that accompany the start of a new trimester. \nWhen individuals come and go from Proctor's five off-campus programs, the community churns in a healthy way. Friend groups welcome new members, roles shift within dorms alongside personalities, teams and afternoon activities find their identity, and classes begin to gain their own unique rhythm.

  "markdown": "Nov 27 2023 8:30 AM\n\nEach trimester brings with it transition -- changes in the weather, new classes, new teams and afternoon programs. Life at Proctor involves more transition than most schools as we welcome back more 40 students from off-campus programs and say goodbye to nearly 40 students embarking on a life-changing experience abroad during the winter months. \n\n![Proctor Academy Community Students](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1700926442/proctoracademyorg/xixw6t9990uj9nx1ygsg/Blog1.jpg)\n\nThese transitions create an added layer of community development, but having almost 20% of our student body transitioning between on campus and off each term breathes vitality into every corner of Proctor’s campus.\n\n![Proctor Academy Community Students](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1700926468/proctoracademyorg/f7wtiqvgfkscwu6b8ldb/Blog3.jpg)\n\nIn many high school social structures, peer groups remain relatively static over the course of the year, but that is simply not the case at Proctor. Sure, if you stop any student returning from [Proctor en Segovia](https://www.proctoracademy.org/fs/pages/446), [European Art Classroom](https://www.proctoracademy.org/fs/pages/371), or [Ocean Classroom](https://www.proctoracademy.org/fs/pages/373) on their way to assembly and ask about their experience this fall, you will likely be regaled with stories about their host family, excursions across Europe, hiking in Segovia, stepping off the SSV Corwith Cramer onto Bermudian soil, watching the sun set, and then rise again with their C Watch partners. Proctor’s off-campus programs create unique bonds within groups of students that last a lifetime, but these relationships do not operate solely within the isolation of that peer group, but instead serve as a catalyst for new relationships to develop across campus along with the other natural social transitions that accompany the start of a new trimester.   \n\n![Proctor Academy Community Students](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1700926483/proctoracademyorg/ikfpbb6nfz1zt75ov4bl/Blog2.jpg)\n\nWhen individuals come and go from Proctor's five off-campus programs, the community churns in a healthy way. Friend groups welcome new members, roles shift within dorms alongside personalities, teams and afternoon activities find their identity, and classes begin to gain their own unique rhythm. This natural transition in community serves Proctor well, but it must be done with intentionality as we reestablish community norms and challenge students to fight against the natural adolescent social tendency to operate in cliques. \n\n![Proctor Academy Community Students](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1700926501/proctoracademyorg/weehplygheikmfp2fbdh/Blog4.jpg)\n\nAs we launch a new trimester, we must encourage our natural winter “groups” - the “Eastern skiers”, the “hockey team”, the “Ocean kids”, the “basketball players”, the “theater kids”, the “Carr House boys”, the “Sally B girls”  - to consider how to make themselves known within the context of the Proctor community, while challenging preconceived notions of their “group”. The good news, [as this article suggests](https://psyche.co/ideas/stereotypes-might-not-be-as-powerful-as-psychologists-assumed), is that stereotypes may not be as powerful as we once thought them to be. Research suggests that current actions are actually more powerful than stereotypes in forming impressions of others. \n\n![Proctor Academy Community Students](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1700926550/proctoracademyorg/mjfqghwgtqfx05lbjg77/Blog5.jpg)\n\nWe have a powerful opportunity this winter to redefine and reframe how we are perceived by others within our groups.

  "text": "If you happened upon 2,500 acres of land in rural New Hampshire, nestled at the foot of Ragged Mountain and along the Blackwater River, and were charged with designing a school, the life sciences and a focus on environmental stewardship would sit at the heart of your educational model. \nWhether it is exploring the woodlands, learning about hunting, fishing, and wildlife management, continuing a decade longitudinal student of the Proctor Pond, visiting local fisheries, learning about native and invasive species, or visiting Cricenti’s Bog in nearby New London, Proctor’s science classes are embracing all that the local area has to teach them this fall. \nToday’s post shines a light on just a few of the projects, assignments, and coursework taking place in science classes through video, photos, and writing. Enjoy! \nTree Identification and Hunting Laws - Wildlife Ecology \nContinuing Proctor’s longstanding commitment to ensuring students utilize our 2,500 acre laboratory, Wildlife Ecology students have engaged in units on hunting laws and policies and tree identification over the past week. As the weather cools, hunting season begins, and the leaves begin to change colors and fall in preparation for winter, Lynne Bartlett uses these units of study to help students understand how to safely, inquisitively navigate our woodlands. \nPhilbrick-Cricenti's Bog - Biology\nEach year, Proctor's biology students travel to nearby Philbrick-Cricenti's bog to study the unique ecosystem that exists in that biological miracle. Not only are the annual trips a great photo opportunity, but students learn the foundations of decay, nutrients, close systems, and how different species are impacted by the environments in which they exist. \nSpecies Speed Dating - AP Environmental Science\nWith more than 40 AP Environmental Science students enrolled in three sections this year, longtime APES teacher and Environmental Coordinator Alan McIntyre invited all students to a species speed dating evening activity last Thursday. For an hour, students were paired together to learn more about “their species” in relation to others. Rotating through one-on-one meetings with other species, they learned about traits, services, threats and niches of different species. After 5-6 rounds they met by taxonomic class to discuss conservation issues and problems their class faces. It was a high energy, high impact evening of learning! \nPond Study - Chemistry and AP Environmental Science \nFor more than a decade, Proctor’s AP Environmental Science class has conducted a longitudinal study of the water quality in the Proctor Pond. While data collection for this study will take place later in the year, Chemistry students in Sue Houston’s classes have been hard at work studying the various species in the pond as they work through their first unit of the year: Water the Essential of Life. Students will then build on this base knowledge by studying the chemistry of photosynthesis in the pond, tracing matter and energy, pond chemistry, and energy transfer through plants. Using “real world” application of the basic principles of chemistry allows students to create a powerful proximity to their learning. \nHuman Movement and Athletic Training - Anatomy and Physiology\nAnatomy and Physiology (and Head Athletic Trainer) Kelly Griffin-Brown utilized her expertise and training to teach students “Stop the Bleed” and suturing techniques during class. Not only are these topics essential for emergency situations students may face, but the training allows each student to better understand their body and how it works. \nNeuroscience\nOver the past week, Buz Morison’s Neuroscience class has investigated molecular/cellular biology of a signal transmission along a neuron, collaborating on problems to challenge each other’s learning. One of Proctor’s primary goals for students is to build understanding of themselves as learners. This work happens in Learning Skills tutorials, with advisors, coaches, dorm parents, and teachers, but there is perhaps no class as powerful as neuroscience for students to truly understand the science of how their brains work based on their biology! \nVector Calculus - College Physics and Calculus \nOne of Proctor’s most rigorous classes, College Physics and Calculus students, under the guidance of Buz Morison, explore vector calculus this week. This combination math/science course challenges Proctor’s brightest, most motivated students to work together to explore complex calculus and physics problems their college science/math courses will present to them in the future. \nRead more about Proctor's Academic Model Here!",

  "text": "Dec 15 2022 10:28 AM \nIt’s part of who we are, part of our history, part of what we move forward. Scraps of the history can be found in the woods behind the football field, a wheel nailed to a maple tree signals the old rope tow. Stories swirl of slope improvement that involve students, dynamite, and a granite stater do-it-yourself mentality. Every institution has legacy, tradition, and it’s important in the current hustle to evolve and to become the new next, legacy is not forgotten. And yet sometimes legacy has to justify itself, and sometimes in the exploration of legacy institutional values are revealed. And that can be a steadying.\nOur ski area is a snowball’s toss from campus. The slap of jumping skis hitting the landing hill pops across the valley when the air is still. The prowl of the groomer is a companion to many nights, as is the hiss of snow guns. Announcements of distances for jumping competitions and racer’s times called out over loudspeakers echo in the valley. These are the sounds of legacy. So why do we do it? Why particularly in a time of climate change when the weather is warmer and the conditions tougher. Proctor had a 40 inch snow storm in mid December and a rain storm on Christmas Day that washed it all away. It’s going to rain again this weekend. Why indeed. \nPerhaps start with the area itself. Sometimes we need the places that offer a little magic, and the ski area, with its jumps, its race trails, its nordic trails offers a bit of that. Winter magic. Awesome nature. And sometimes a school like Proctor, with all of its opportunity and privileges wrapped and held so tightly in the bundle of the immediate campus, needs to find ways to give back. Just across the Blackwater River is that place that gives back. Of particular note: there are more families, more high school skiers in all disciplines, more collegiate skiers that come from outside of Proctor than come from inside. Hands down. There are the smallest of the smalls who learn to ski. There are Olympians who never attended Proctor but have been on our hill, off our jumps, around our Nordic trails. High school buses roll up every afternoon from Concord, Bow, and Sutton. College vans pull in from all over the northeast. We don’t run that area to keep it to ourselves; we run the Proctor Ski Area to give back. To share a little of the magic. Nothing else that we do has such a broad reach outside of the immediate Proctor community. \nIt’s also about teaching some of the lessons that can be learned on snow. Hard lessons, life lessons. It’s not about having the fanciest skis or the fastest time. At any given competition there is only one fastest time, one longest jump. But at any given competition there is the expectation that effort and the willingness to fall and fail and get up again are essential. And the falls can be hard, sometimes happening from great height and high speeds. Safety netting is not optional. True in any sport? Not to this degree. The weather changes, the wax changes, the snow conditions change, so the athlete can bring their best technique and fitness but if they can’t adjust for any of these and other variables on any given day, success proves elusive. Try going off the 38 meter jump on a windy day or skiing the course ruts common for racers at the end of the start list. In these disciplines that can sometimes breed unbearable arrogance, sometimes the greatest humility is found. Certainly grit. Absolutely resilience. \nThere’s a picture in the archives that shows the whole school on skis being towed by a tractor past Slocumb. We are not that school anymore, not that community where everyone has to ski. That’s been a good evolution. We need the breadth and diversity of our current offering, but we are still the school that believes in snow sports for many reasons and know the good lessons learned on snow find their way back into communities and businesses and the classroom. \nMike Henriques P'11, P'15\nProctor Academy Head of School (2005-2021)",

  "text": "Dec 6 2022 10:32 AM \nWhile it was ninety degrees and sunny in Andover, New Hampshire yesterday, the ski season never truly stops for Proctors USS/FIS ski program. Over the past two weeks, twenty-three athletes and four coaches traveled to Saas Fee, Switzerland for an intensive training and team bonding experience, all while immersing themselves in European culture. \nServing as a launching pad for the 2022-2023 season, Proctor’s USS/FIS Saas Fee training camp affords athletes and coaches the opportunity to test out new equipment, establish team culture, and dig deeply into fundamental skill development. Much like the team’s June training camp in Mount Hood (read more HERE), the intensive two week experience immerses students in an intensive training environment supplemented by hiking, zip line adventures, dry land training, and intentional recovery. \nAfter being welcomed to the Saas Fee glacier with two days of bad weather, the group made the most of their next six days of training, progressing through slalom and GS training with a focus on form and technique. Despite a wide range of abilities among athletes present, coaches reflected in their daily training log the positive attitudes, attention to detail, and remarkable growth between the early camp training days and execution of drills and course work later in camp. Mid-camp off days saw the group hike to an ice-cold spring, zip line across a canyon, play soccer, volleyball, and spend considerable time on mobility and stretching. \nProctor’s Director of Alpine Skiing, Jason “Moot” Nelson notes, “This place (Saas Fee) is incredible. These camps are almost like a mini off-campus program for our students where they are immersed in cultural experiences, learn how to travel, interact with others, and live in community with one another. We are so fortunate to be able to provide this training camp experience to our athletes and are incredibly thankful to Proctor and our families for helping make it happen!” Students reflect on their experience in Saas Fee below. \nLiberty ’26\n\"Saas Fee was an incredible trip to go on as a new student. I was able to meet teammates, and bond in an enjoyable and special way. The Saas Fee trip is also a good way to meet new coaches, and test out new equipment. I feel so much better about going into the next season knowing everything works and that I have so many amazing coaches. Finally, Saas Fee is an adventure! I had so much fun flying with my friends, trying new food, and going on adventures every day. The Mountain Coaster and the ice cream hike were two of my favorites. This trip was a great way to train and travel, it was an amazing summer adventure.\"\nTurner ‘25\n\"Being in Saas-Fee is breathtaking. While roaming in town, you are surrounded by sky-scraping mountains and diverse cultures. Meanwhile, up on the glacier, the snow is spectacular and you train alongside some of the world’s most successful skiers. For me, this trip was not only a great way to develop my skiing technique, but also an eye-opener to the beauty of Switzerland. Such a transformative experience would not have been possible without the support of our coaches; Moot, Justin, Mamie, and Craig.\"\nEli ‘24 \n“Saas-Fee was incredible. I never thought much about traveling to Europe, but the vast countryside and the luscious fields were definitely a sight to behold. Besides the scenery, the skiing was amazing. I was able to increase my skills before the season arrives on campus in a few months. The level of support and teaching from the coaches definitely helped as well; it was helpful to receive feedback from all of the coaches, not just the FIS Men coaches.”",

  "text": "Since the 1940s and 1950s when all students were required to ski during the winter months, Proctor Academy’s identity has been rooted in snow sports. Today, the school is proud to announce that U.S. Ski & Snowboard has named Proctor Academy a Gold-certified club, the highest honor granted by U.S. Ski & Snowboard. \nThe process of achieving Gold level certification as a club provides an opportunity for the National Governing Body, U.S. Ski & Snowboard, to assess a club’s current situation and determine areas of need. Gold certified clubs possess a heightened level of accountability to maintain and build upon areas of both strength and improvement, to ensure the longevity and stability of the organization and to help, through feedback and observation, to grow the cumulative strength of clubs throughout regions and across the country. Proctor becomes just the third school of its type in the country - a coeducational boarding and day school - to achieve Gold Certification. \nAs the Gold Certification Committee noted upon visiting Proctor, “Leadership transitions can be an opportunity for an organization to take the time to reflect on its cultural heritage, while assessing its current state and looking ahead with fresh eyes.” Skiing lives deep within the Proctor's DNA and as new Head of School Brian Thomas stepped into his role, he eagerly leaned on the institutional knowledge and commitment to snow sports of those who have been a part of the Proctor community for decades, including current and past coaches, former Head of School Mike Henriques, former Alpine Program Directors David and Morgan Salathe, school leadership, members of the Athletic Department, the Board of Trustees, snow sport advisor Jed Hinkley '98, as well as Proctor Ski Area Manager Garry George '78 and his crew.\nBrian notes, “Proctor is more than a ski academy. And, we are heartened by the endorsement by US Ski & Snowboard. Proctor will be a shining example of this recognition in all its facets. We strive to get one day better everyday and to be a beacon for other schools as well as snow sport athletes who want to compete at the highest level while attending a great boarding school where they can expand their identities. It starts with those within the Proctor community who are deeply committed to the student experience - on snow, in the classroom, and throughout the entirety of Proctor's educational model.\"\nCurrent and past parent, Member of Proctor’s Board of Trustees, and Foundation Trustee for USSS Armins Rusis, P’19, ‘24 reflects, “Becoming a Gold Certified Club is a recognition of the commitment and hard work of the broader Proctor family over the decades and acknowledges the role that the Proctor plays in the local, state and national snow sports communities. We are excited to continue to work with USSS and its local members to be a critical partner in advancing snow sports in the US.” \nFellow parent and Member of Proctor’s Board of Trustees and former US Ski Team member, Kate Krehbiel, adds, “As a parent of a ski racer, we were drawn to Proctor because they had it all, a year round high level training and racing program, amazing coaches, its own ski area, combined with best in class academics. After four years, seeing my child emerge as competitive on the hill is great. What is better is seeing him be nurtured and mentored by coaches and faculty with intellect, integrity and a commitment to values deeper than sports performance. We are grateful to all the incredible people in the Proctor community.\" \nThe U.S. Ski & Snowboard Certification Committee remarked in their analysis of Proctor as a Gold Candidate, “It was clear to the USSS certification team that Proctor’s leadership is committed to honoring its heritage and leveraging its uniqueness while doubling down on its commitment to excellence, including in the area of snow sports. Despite the transition of several new people into key roles over the past couple years, the Proctor certification team, including the new Head of School Brian Thomas, and a new Alpine Program Director, Moot Nelson, has really gelled over the time we have worked together.”\nMoot adds, “We could not be more excited for our school and our on-snow programs. This Gold Certification exemplifies the commitment of excellence in snow sports and academics, and celebrates our ability to push our students to achieve their goals on snow and beyond.\"\nProctor began the certification process with being awarded Bronze in 2017. Since then, the school has worked through the necessary steps to advance to Silver and beyond. US Ski and Snowboard Club Development Manager notes, “U.S. Ski & Snowboard’s Podium Club Certification Program requires a rigorous, mission driven self-assessment and review of best principles and practices in eight areas of organizational performance. Proctor has demonstrated excellence in all areas and is recognized as an important partner of U.S. Ski & Snowboard and a leader among ski and snowboard clubs. As a Gold certified club, Proctor serves as a model of excellence, both organizationally and athletically, and is a valuable resource to winter sport in the U.S.” \nThe Gold Level Certification provides unique professional development opportunities for staff, affords the school participation in regional and national leadership forums, and access to aggregate data specific to podium certified clubs. As Proctor continues to support its snow sport programs, coaches, and athletes, Director of Athletics Gregor Makechnie ‘90 notes, “Our students and coaches benefit from our partnership with USSS as we endeavor to deliver the best possible on-snow experience. U.S. Ski & Snowboard is a phenomenal resource, helping us to hone our approach to enhancing performance through assistance with training strategies, coaching methodology, strength and conditioning, and sport psychology. For Proctor, it is gratifying to be acknowledged through Gold Certification for our commitment to high level on-snow experiences coupled with rigorous academics and rich social experience for high school-aged students.”",

We are excited to continue to work with USSS and its local members to be a critical partner in advancing snow sports in the US.” \n\nFellow parent and Member of Proctor’s Board of Trustees and former US Ski Team member, Kate Krehbiel, adds, “As a parent of a ski racer, we were drawn to Proctor because they had it all, a year round high level training and racing program, amazing coaches, its own ski area, combined with best in class academics. After four years, seeing my child emerge as competitive on the hill is great. What is better is seeing him be nurtured and mentored by coaches and faculty with intellect, integrity and a commitment to values deeper than sports performance. We are grateful to all the incredible people in the Proctor community.\" \n\n![Proctor on Snow](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1678718072/proctoracademyorg/kec3wtnvxubdfwl3sm3z/OnSnow32.jpg)\n\nThe U.S. Ski & Snowboard Certification Committee remarked in their analysis of Proctor as a Gold Candidate, “It was clear to the USSS certification team that Proctor’s leadership is committed to honoring its heritage and leveraging its uniqueness while doubling down on its commitment to excellence, including in the area of snow sports. Despite the transition of several new people into key roles over the past couple years, the Proctor certification team, including the new Head of School Brian Thomas, and a new Alpine Program Director, Moot Nelson, has really gelled over the time we have worked together.”\n\nMoot adds, “We could not be more excited for our school and our on-snow programs. This Gold Certification exemplifies the commitment of excellence in snow sports and academics, and celebrates our ability to push our students to achieve their goals on snow and beyond.\"\n\nProctor began the certification process with being awarded [Bronze in 2017](https://blogs.proctoracademy.org/proctor-academy-earns-ussa-bronze-level-podium-certification). Since then, the school has worked through the necessary steps to advance to Silver and beyond. US Ski and Snowboard Club Development Manager notes, “U.S. Ski & Snowboard’s Podium Club Certification Program requires a rigorous, mission driven self-assessment and review of best principles and practices in eight areas of organizational performance. Proctor has demonstrated excellence in all areas and is recognized as an important partner of U.S. Ski & Snowboard and a leader among ski and snowboard clubs. As a Gold certified club, Proctor serves as a model of excellence, both organizationally and athletically, and is a valuable resource to winter sport in the U.S.” \n\nThe Gold Level Certification provides unique professional development opportunities for staff, affords the school participation in regional and national leadership forums, and access to aggregate data specific to podium certified clubs. As Proctor continues to support its snow sport programs, coaches, and athletes, Director of Athletics Gregor Makechnie ‘90 notes, “Our students and coaches benefit from our partnership with USSS as we endeavor to deliver the best possible on-snow experience. U.S. Ski & Snowboard is a phenomenal resource, helping us to hone our approach to enhancing performance through assistance with training strategies, coaching methodology, strength and conditioning, and sport psychology. For Proctor, it is gratifying to be acknowledged through Gold Certification for our commitment to high level on-snow experiences coupled with rigorous academics and rich social experience for high school-aged students.”"

Over the course of the two week training camp, coaches and athletes progressed from free skiing to fundamental skill work to constraint courses, and shorter course sets as athletes refined technical and tactical skills. \nEastern Alpine Program Director Jason Nelson notes, “I am very pleased with the efforts of our students coaches during this prep period. Over the past six months, our athletes have been building toward the start of this season, and that consistent hard work is already paying off.” He adds, “Our camp in Mount Hood (June) provided incredible volume with turn count and a great surface, while our camp in Corralco, Chile (August) provided much needed free skiing and time on snow. To top off this prep period, Panorama afforded an incredible environment where the snow surface, training venues, and quick turnaround allowed for an optimal teaching and learning environment.” \nThe Panorama Camp (November 17-December 4) focused U16 athletes on Giant Slalom and Super G training, with some Slalom training mixed in. The group skied over 300 Super G turns during their camp, getting to know now only themselves as athletes, but each other and the coaching staff. This group’s focus for the year is to attack the hill, and not the gates, and the training period reinforced this mindset. \nProctor’s FIS athletes arrived a few days later to Panorama, and focused their training on Slalom and Giant Slalom, while also spending ample time in their Super G skis over the two weeks. With a good portion of the group prepping for a race series in Norquay at the end of the camp, their training and focus from coaches sought to push individual limits and speed thresholds.

  "text": "Feb 25 2023 8:00 AM \nThe Winter Term often finds us diving deeply into our own worlds. Perhaps it is our instinctive nature as the days get short and the weather colder, to pull into ourselves. We put our nose down, and, too often, our blinders up so that we can concentrate on that which lies before us: our classes, our teams, our dorms, our advisories. We can easily overlook the complexity of all that is happening on this campus until weekends like this one put the fullness of who we are on display. \nEach day, we see faces of our colleagues and students walk by on the paths.

  "markdown": "Feb 25 2023 8:00 AM\n\nThe Winter Term often finds us diving deeply into our own worlds. Perhaps it is our instinctive nature as the days get short and the weather colder, to pull into ourselves. We put our nose down, and, too often, our blinders up so that we can concentrate on that which lies before us: our classes, our teams, our dorms, our advisories. We can easily overlook the complexity of all that is happening on this campus until weekends like this one put the fullness of who we are on display. \n\n![Proctor Academy Arts](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1678708601/proctoracademyorg/j62dbgg6tinbgh3dyfkt/Arts41.jpg)\n\nEach day, we see faces of our colleagues and students walk by on the paths.

Read more about the latest exhibits on display on Proctor’s campus. \nChris and Leah Reid: Plein Air Artists on Display \nLocated in the Brown Dining Commons upstairs exhibit, the en plein air landscape art of Chris and Leah Reid, a mother/daughter artist duo, is now on display. Molly met Chris at a Plein Air painting weekend at the Fells Estate during the summer of 2022 and is excited to feature both Chris and Leah’s pastels and video/sound installation in the Brown Dining Commons from January-May 2023. Chris will visit Proctor’s studio art classes during the Spring Term. \nThe installation on display, Sounding Landscapes—Bee Conservancy, is a collaborative installation by Chris and Leah Reid. The installation brings together visual and sonic art forms, combining a painted landscape with an immersive soundscape composition. The work highlights pollinator gardens and the important creatures that live among us. The visual portion of the work was painted by Chris Reid and consists of a large, life-size 3-panel plein air landscape of Chris’ gardens. The work is filled with an explosion of vibrant floral colors and textures. The sound portion of the work, composed by Leah Reid, comprises a 20-minute composition that encapsulates sounds of Jaffrey center—the historic meeting house’s bell ringing in the distance, the sound of bees, hornets, and insects humming and buzzing, geese flying south, birds, and trees swaying in the wind. In the piece, these sounds are combined with Chris speaking about her inspirations, garden, and the sounds and rhythms of her painting en plein air. The listener hears Chris’ unique stroke work and the process of completing the piece from underpainting to final touches.\nChris Reid is an internationally respected New Hampshire artist known for her landscapes and still life paintings. Her work is noted for its intense color and masterful use of light. Art New England describes Reid’s work as being “rich in color” and her landscapes have been praised for their “powerful abstract elements.” Reid has been the recipient of numerous national and international awards, including: the “Best in Show” from the National Northeast Pastel Exhibition, the Jack Richeson & Company Award V at the Connecticut Pastel Society’s 34th Annual Members Exhibit, the Lovely Lines Award at the Pastel Societies of NH and VT’s joint show, the Pastel Journal Award from Maine’s 7th Annual International Juried Exhibit, the Dick Blick Award from the 4th Annual Northeast Pastel Exhibition, and the Artist Clean Air Award, the Passion for Pastels Award, the People's Choice Award, the Mary Costigan Award for Excellence in Still Life Award and the Seacoast Pastel Painters Award from the Pastel Society of New Hampshire's Member's Exhibitions, among many others. Reid’s work can be found in galleries across New England and in homes around the world. For additional information, please visit www.chrisreidstudio.com.\nLeah Reid is a composer, sound artist, researcher, and educator, whose works range from opera, chamber, and vocal music, to acousmatic, electroacoustic works, and interactive sound installations. Winner of a 2022 Guggenheim Fellowship, Reid has also won the American Prize in Composition, first prize in the KLANG! International Electroacoustic Composition Competition, Sound of the Year’s Composed with Sound Award, the International Alliance for Women in Music’s Pauline Oliveros Award, and prizes in the Iannis Xenakis International Electronic Music Competition and the International Destellos Competition. She has received fellowships from the Guerilla Opera Company, Transient Canvas, the Hambidge Center, MacDowell, the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, the Ucross Foundation, and Yaddo. Her compositions have been presented at festivals, conferences, and major venues throughout the world. She is currently an Assistant Professor of Music Composition at the University of Virginia. Additional information may be found at www.leahreidmusic.com.\nArt Acquisitions: Misoo Bang \nLast spring, Proctor’s Head of School Brian Thomas acquired the school’s first painting from artist Richard Haynes. This winter, the school announces the acquisition to two additional pieces, one, Misoo Bang’s Giant Asian Girl, JiYoung, purchased and donated by Brian Thomas and the second, Giant Asian Girl 10, was purchased by the school. Misoo’s artwork has been on display in the Lovejoy Library throughout the Fall of 2022. She was born in the Bronx and moved to Korea when she was one. She presently lives in South Burlington, VT and teaches art and art history at UVM. She was selected as one of the Emerging Artists of New England in 2019 and Vermont Artist to Watch in 2020.\nHer work is deeply personal and is about empowering young women, particularly young Asian women. Her mixed media approach integrates childhood memories with her highly technical and beautifully rendered figures. This style, coupled with her voice of empowerment, is what initially drew me to her work. Her work invites viewers to reconsider the perception that, in her perspective, \"... Asian women being perceived as delicate, erotic and submissive...\" \nAmy Fortier: Contemporary Mandalas Exhibit January 2023-May 2023\nLooking ahead to the new year, Amy Fortier’s contemporary mandala work will be on exhibit in the Lovejoy Library from January 2023 - May of 2023. Amy is an artist inspired by color, henna tattoos, Moroccan tile work, mandalas, and patterns of all kinds. I specialize in detailed mandala images and coloring posters. She has been doodling, crafting, and dabbling in art since she could first hold a crayon, but did not start to show her work publicly until she applied to paint, of all things, a 4 foot tall fiberglass pig as part of Hanover, NH’s 250th Anniversary celebration in 2011. \nWhen not creating or teaching art, Amy is a personal trainer at the River Valley Club in Lebanon, NH, sings with Gerry Grimo’s East Bay Jazz Ensemble, and volunteers the rest of her spare time with North Country Community Theatre’s Teen Program, as well as performing in their summer productions.",

  "text": "Feb 23 2023 7:55 AM \nProctor Theater is proud to present the showing of Little Women, the musical, on Friday, February 17 and Saturday, February 18 at 7:00 pm in the Wilkins Meeting House.\nFor as long as we can remember, Proctor’s theater department produced a spring musical. The culmination of a year in the performing arts as the weather warms, we prepare for graduation, and the end of the year feels idyllic, but in reality, it placed an incredible amount of stress on our actors and theater faculty as they prepared the biggest show of the year during the shortest term. A switch to a winter musical this year provides a lift to the community during the final weeks of the Winter Term, and what a lift it will be! \nBased on Louisa May Alcott’s classic novel, Little Women follows the adventures of four sisters - Jo, Meg, Beth, and Amy March - as they grow up in Civil War America. With a book by Allan Knee, lyrics by Mindi Dickstein, and music by Jason Howland, Little Women opened on Broadway in 2005, and has since toured domestically and internationally with critical acclaim. The musical weaves short vignettes of Jo’s writing into the story of the March sister’s lives. \nProctor’s production of Little Women will have you laughing, crying, and simply entranced by the talent on stage supported by a remarkable technical crew. Helen Armstrong ‘23 (Jo), Paige Makechnie ‘25 (Amy), Lisle Coombs ‘24 (Meg), and Sophie Mason ‘24 (Beth) play the four March sisters, while Aria Simmons ‘26 plays the girls’ mother, Marmee. Austin Easterly ‘25 (Laurie), Dylan Stern ‘23 (Professor Bhaer), Em Hackmann ’24 (Aunt March), Jaden Williams ’25 (John Brooke) and Aaron Caro-Barzey '26 (Mr. Laurence) complement the female leads with wit and excellent stage presence throughout the show. Additionally, Violet Kraft-Lund Marley '24, Riley DuPont '24, Jackson Gamache '24, Hazel Curry '26, and Amena Martinez-Paris '26 do an outstanding job as Operatic Tragedy players throughout the show. \nThe cast and crew of Little Women should be proud of their hard work and this gift of theater they have given to the Proctor and local Andover community. As the actors share in the video above, it is the culmination of hard work that makes being a part of a production so energizing. We watch as individual roles develop, evolve, and transform alongside the set, lights, and sound design to produce a beautiful end product. \nThe process of a show coming together is not unlike that of a community, where each individual becomes increasingly connected to the whole. Be sure to come out to enjoy the show this weekend, reserving your free tickets in advance of the show HERE or tuning in LIVE using this link, to see the hard work of the cast and crew of Little Women! \nClick here to see more photos from Little Women on Flickr!",

Helen Armstrong ‘23 (Jo), Paige Makechnie ‘25 (Amy), Lisle Coombs ‘24 (Meg), and Sophie Mason ‘24 (Beth) play the four March sisters, while Aria Simmons ‘26 plays the girls’ mother, Marmee. Austin Easterly ‘25 (Laurie), Dylan Stern ‘23 (Professor Bhaer), Em Hackmann ’24 (Aunt March), Jaden Williams ’25 (John Brooke) and Aaron Caro-Barzey '26 (Mr. Laurence) complement the female leads with wit and excellent stage presence throughout the show. Additionally, Violet Kraft-Lund Marley '24, Riley DuPont '24, Jackson Gamache '24, Hazel Curry '26, and Amena Martinez-Paris '26 do an outstanding job as Operatic Tragedy players throughout the show. \n\n![Proctor Academy Arts](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1678708454/proctoracademyorg/rs1athaqt9rrqhf0mzzw/Arts3.jpg)\n\n The cast and crew of Little Women should be proud of their hard work and this gift of theater they have given to the Proctor and local Andover community. As the actors share in the video above, it is the culmination of hard work that makes being a part of a production so energizing. We watch as individual roles develop, evolve, and transform alongside the set, lights, and sound design to produce a beautiful end product. \n\nThe process of a show coming together is not unlike that of a community, where each individual becomes increasingly connected to the whole. Be sure to come out to enjoy the show this weekend, reserving your free tickets in advance of the show [HERE](https://www.ticketsource.us/proctor-theater/e-ppxjza) or tuning in [LIVE](https://www.showtix4u.com/event-details/70416) using this link, to see the hard work of the cast and crew of Little Women! \n\n[**Click here to see more photos from _Little Women_ on Flickr!**](https://blogs.proctoracademy.org/cs/c/?cta_guid=9bd14f98-1b16-4510-be3e-1f4baaaa39a4&signature=AAH58kG_dsMbzFroKabRdem_-d0zIO8iTg&pageId=102846469198&placement_guid=9d977296-abb4-40af-b659-f7f1656021a3&click=49b8c3e6-0bf4-46a7-ba01-500aec4823bf&hsutk=8380f9b086d8c936a008226094ed485e&canon=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.proctoracademy.org%2Fproctor-theater-presents-little-women&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&portal_id=408790&redirect_url=APefjpFGO4i9O3j0HsIn4ZyrETxySQIW9o4Sm_7jTucA4Lf2DXhbOtgz6_nWI63C9bBOfe5WadDqX2u8pYyLDJ_cUqX2gvgcYvU2FQ7VDe_k5Py5SevcYqBZ6H7DlAsLqIs4TJs-J3W9g4Z3MmB3Vxo73m_810hmDLE5oe3hQROyh5BBrVv--fZ7ampxXqFE5cRLxRrNYp9rCtQhIgVxlo1_BCWPTfkOGOIOi8PL7u0vGL8zf8kfTuXjQvKngsUvo51TLh3rJ_6OorPJPsg6dplBup7ki1jKUk_XxAa8QXctuQbpLkejDl8lLPVUswtY0XPrNcMyNXvY&__hstc=64846384.8380f9b086d8c936a008226094ed485e.1662494660989.1678666752237.1678707883422.387&__hssc=64846384.3.1678707883422&__hsfp=1411068630&contentType=blog-post \"Click here to see more photos from Little Women on Flickr!\")"

With the support of the production team, the cast (including a number of faculty and staff) and crew, produced a show that will make you laugh, cry, and have faith in how friendships can evolve over time.\nMean Girls: The Musical, written by Tina Fey, with lyrics by Nell Benjamin and music by Jeff Richmond, is based on the movie of the same name. Our favorite character from the film hit the stage as Janis Sarkisian (Lily Rusis ‘24) and Damian Hubbard (Austin Easterly ‘26) open the show with an introduction to Cady Heron (Violet Kraft-Lund Marley ‘24) as the “new girl” at North Shore High School. Janis and Damian befriend Cady, and a complicated journey of high school cliques, love, loyalty, family, friendship unfolds alongside Queen Bee Regina (Lily Mathison ‘24) and her friends Gretchen Wieners (Paige Makechnie ‘25) and Karen Smith (Sophie Mason ‘25) and Cady’s crush, Aaron Samuels (Jaden Williams ‘25). \nAdditional cast members Kevin Gnapoor (Aaron Caro-Barzey ‘26), Ms. Norbury (Kate Jones, Faculty), Mrs. George (Lynne Bartlett, Faculty), Mr. Duvall (Marc Flaherty, Faculty), Coach Carr (Gregor Makechnie, Faculty/Admin), Mrs. Heron (Christine Piquette, Staff), Mr. Heron (Kurt Croft, Chief Resource Manager), and “Teachers” (Alicia Barry - Faculty, and Laurel Shinerock - Faculty). Ensemble members round out the talented cast - Emily Alexander ‘27, Brennan Dunklee ‘27, Taylor Shove ‘27, Lydia Cressey-Dodge ‘27, Em Hackmann ‘24, Aria Simmons ‘26, Hazel Curry ‘26, Ozzy Labrie ‘26, Amena Martinez-Paris ‘26, Lisle Coombs ‘24, Penny Mathison ‘27, and Claudia Weller ‘26 - with support from a Technical Crew of Griffin Murie '26, Winnie Walker '24, Isla Delaney '25, Gypsy Veritae '27, Olivia Kewenvoyouma '25, and Will Brinson '26. \nSupporting the cast and crew is an equally talented group of adults - Amy Mathison, Director, Alyssa Costa, Musical Director, Margaret Fair '19, Choreographer, Starr Fair, Technical Director, Joan Saunders, Costume Director, Seth Currier '95, Sound Designer, and Steven Meier, Lighting Designer. \nWe hope you come out to see Mean Girls: The Musical on Friday and Saturday evenings at 7:00 PM in the Wilkins Meeting House. Reserve your free tickets to the show HERE. Please note, due to adult themes and content, the show is not recommended for children under the age of 13. A special thank you to Alex Estin for running the box office. A stream of the show is available HERE, however, due to licensing fees and contracts, streaming of the event will take place through a third party vendor. \nCheck out photos from Proctor’s production of Mean Girls: The Musical!",

In both the performing and visual arts, students learn to engage, to trust, to accept that perfection is an untenable goal, so progress and expression of self becomes the priority. \nThey learn that practice makes progress, and that vulnerability is not a sign of weakness, but strength.

  "text": "Proctor’s Visual Arts Department offers opportunities in studio art, ceramics, photography, metal sculpture, woodworking, metal engineering, industrial and creative design, and textile arts. As students paint, draw, develop, produce, craft, and sew, they are guided by an amazing group of faculty members who are artists in their own right. \nAdults and students create metal sculptures in the forge, learn to work with state-of-the-art lathes, planers, saws, presses, and a variety of electric and hand tools to design and build high-quality guitars, a variety of boat types, and fine furniture of all kinds. Students use both local and exotic woods, some cut from Proctor’s own timber stand. Students learn to weld and shape metal to create intricate and functional projects ranging from center punches, pepper grinders, bicycles, and utility trailers. \nProctor’s Visual Arts Department faculty help students tap into their creative side, regardless of prior experience or ability level. Read more about this amazing group of educators below in this week’s Departmental Profile! \nHow long have you been at Proctor? \nKate Austin ‘01 | 11 years (Ceramics, Photography) \nGordon Bassett ‘96 | 10 years (Metal Engineering) \nJill Jones Grotnes | 10 years (Studio Art, Textile Arts) \nCorby Leith ‘92 | 11 years (Studio Art, Metal Sculpture) \nMolly Leith | 5 years (Visual Arts Department Chair, Ceramics) \nMike Walsh | 22 years (Digital Arts) \nWhat is your favorite part of your working in the Visual Arts at Proctor? \nKate: Slocumb is also a very magical place on campus! Anyone who has spent time there knows what I’m talking about. As a student, I fell in love with the space and I’m honored to be able to share that same experience with students as part of the faculty. My favorite part of my job is working with students' to develop their craft. Meeting each of them where they are at and guiding them through the process to find success is truly rewarding. Some days it's nothing to do with the medium that we are teaching, but more about the individual and the space.\nGordon: Working with students. The creativity that comes from students when they are empowered by learning new skills.\nJill: How excited students get when they learn to sew and make their first item. \nCorby: The students and sharing with them what I love.\nMolly: I absolutely love the diversity of expertise we have in the Art Department and the love each instructor brings to their class.\nMike: Great group of motivated individuals I get to work alongside. \nIf you could take part in ONE of Proctor's Off-Campus Programs or take ONE class at Proctor, what would it be?\nKate: As a student, I really wanted to go on Mountain Classroom. However, if European Art Classrooms had existed back then, I would have loved to do that program. I also wish I had taken Forestry with Dave Pilla and Woodworking with Greg Allen.\nGordon: I went on Ocean Classroom voyage #1 as a PA student. I would love to see the PA Mountain Classroom program.\nJill: I would take wood shop with Greg or French.

I enjoy the whole process starting with just a simple seed, nurturing the plants as they grow, to enjoying the freshness you only get when you pick your own vegetable, to processing and canning the extra, and enjoying the veggies throughout the winter months.

  "text": "Nov 2 2023 9:00 PM \nProctor’s Performing Arts Department is thrilled to present Lost Girl as its fall play production. Kimberly Belflower's \"Lost Girl\" is a coming-of-age drama that explores the challenges and complexities of growing up, focusing on the experiences of Wendy Darling from J.M. Barrie's \"Peter Pan.\" Years after returning from her adventure in Neverland, Wendy remains fixated on her beloved Peter and the childhood magic she left. \nThe cast and crew have been working hard over the past two months to get ready for the show under the direction of Charley Stern ‘09. In his director’s note, Charley shares, “Why this play? Why this audience? Why now? These are the first three questions I ask before choosing any show. Lost Girl is a story about young people on the brink of adulthood. In the words of the playwright: ‘I write for and about young people because there is so much life in-between. Because of those feelings. Because of that search for light. Because the things we experience at that age are real, and they matter.’”\nCharley adds, “Whether these Proctor students have flown off to Neverland or are simply experiencing living away from home for the first time, this play speaks to their experience. It deals with the immediacy of life, the immediacy of first loves, leaving home, and daring to move forward when life gets hard. Living in the in-between can be as unsteadying as it can be exhilarating. Lost Girl illustrates that both can be true at once, indeed that so many things can be true at once. This production seeks to celebrate those truths.” \nThe cast includes Greta Campbell stepping into the lead role of Wendy, while Austin Easterly ‘26 plays Peter, Taylor Shove plays Nina and Curly, Isabella Guzman plays Cora, Em Hackman ‘24 plays Callie, and Addy Boucher ‘27 plays Krista. Lily Zhang ‘24 (Mother), Hazel Kane '27 (Slightly), Hazel Curry ‘26 (Toodles/Therapist), Lydia Cressey-Dodge (Nibs/Detective), Aidan Myers (Doctor), and Burke Pekala (Boy) all take the stage throughout the show as well. Behind the scenes, the Drama Tech crew of Hazel Kane '27, Htet Phyu ‘27, Isabella Venus ‘27, Margaux Weatherhead '27, Kiara Cruz '26, Austin Easterly '24, Linden Morgan '26, and Lily Zhang ‘24, with support from Joan Saunders, Alyssa Costa, Starr Fair, and Seth Currier, ensure the show’s set, sound, lights, and technical aspects go off without a hitch. \nWe hope to see you in the Wilkins Meeting House on Friday and Saturday evenings at 7:00 PM to see Lost Girl. Reserve your free tickets HERE. \nAdditionally, Proctor’s Visual Arts Department will host its annual Fall Art Show on Monday, November 13 at 6:00 PM in the Wilkins Meeting House. Student work from woodworking, metal engineering, metal sculpture, studio art, ceramics, and photography will be on display prior to a 7:00 PM Jazz vocal, instrumental, and dance performance. All events are open to the public. \nCheck out more photos from Proctor's Arts on Flickr!",

  "text": "The east end of the Proctor campus has been a-buzz with activity since the start of the school year. Cruising into Slocumb Hall, as many folks around campus often will on any given day, you see the usual order and light. The first thing you notice is how peaceful and still the room feels, even as students file into the space. \nListen to Brian read his blog here. \nEverything is in its place even though the space itself is well-worn and well-cared for in our current school context. Tucked away in corners you see art emerging in creation, as major projects begin to bloom in the Hall’s main room. Slocumb Hall had many uses during its long life, including a stable and the school’s gymnasium. Your eyes can’t help but gaze up to the ceiling where splat marks dart the wooden rafters – pieces of clay – signaling both rites of passages and creativity at play as students still throw clay pieces to mark some milestone or just because. \nOn my first visit to Slocumb, I was also encouraged to “throw some clay,” which I did as it came up and eventually came down out of the rafters. I wonder how many other schools can boast this kind of counter-culture action as a normal way of “doing school.” It’s as if the room itself is daring its inhabitants to ‘drop all pretenses and get down to work/play.’ The space itself demands that a person cut loose and stop the posing. Often the quiet thrum of teachers and students thinking through and collaborating on projects, pieces, demonstrations, and joyful banter permeate the place. Mentioned by many students on last year’s survey of “the place where I feel the happiest on campus,” Slocumb certainly engages the senses and ignites the soul of all those who choose to partake.\nThe art spaces in and around the campus are all, in their way, like Slocumb Hall. Giving voice to the mouthless and wordless buildings is about the summoning of the “P” in “Powerful” spaces. Slocumb Hall and the teachers and students who “live there”' provide a sense of the vitality of Proctor’s art studio as a well lived in and even better used and loved haunt of our students and faculty. During school hours, each area is filled with light and energy. Making way to the drying rack in the back, you see the past pottery projects ready to be glazed. While in the ante-room before thronging into the main room, all sorts of corks and yarn and pieces of material that is used to make found art live there. Students and teachers alike understand that in order to play, you have to use things that demand to be used in a variety of ways, whether the object is hot glued or traced or manipulated in some way to achieve an effect. Making an impact is what art can be about. Essentially the art barn that is Slocumb Hall serves as a kind of hub to the sense and sensibilities of hundreds, if not thousands of Proctor people who have gone through the program and have found their purchase among the paints, clay, and other materials to make something.\nNot more than forty yards away, just north of the much loved industrial arts complex – metal works, forge, wood shop, welding studio – are the Wilkins Meeting House and the Music Buildings. Both are getting a workout just, like Slocumb does, as have the visual and industrial arts building have gotten over the years. In our time as a school, Proctor has seen transformative productions in the Meeting House, the Wise Center, and even in the Stone Chapel way back in the day. Likewise, the Music Studio courses and teams with students coming in and out every single day, making it also one of the favorite places of many. Students have slayed monsters and tamed ogres in the Norris Family Theater, and have rehearsed for Jazz/Rock Ensembles and recorded original music in the Music Studio. What is exciting for many of our current students and faculty can be seen in the collaboration of newer faculty with those familiar faces that our students have come to know and trust. Just like the excellence pursued on the visual and industrial arts side, our performing arts productions and performances this year will continue to upfront Proctor-specific high standards in the theater and the music arena. \nWhen you look closely these days after school you will see a fall play being rehearsed in the Wilkins Meeting House as well as students grappling with some harmony or melody downstairs in the Music Studios whisper rooms. \nAs wonderful as these places are, they could not exist without the tireless efforts of our Visual and Performing Arts faculty. Although the department has been separated in two (NOTE: We had one department up until the current school year), the objective remains the same: To explore the nature and boundaries of creativity in whatever art or medium a student chooses. The people who teach at Proctor are our strength; many of whom are working and practicing artists, performers, and musicians themselves. \nWe cannot wait until our community of seasoned applauders and supporters of the arts get to dive into this new season already underway with students and adults of Proctor leading the way. Prepare to be transformed once again.\nBrian W. Thomas, Proctor Academy Head of School \nCurated Reading:\nToday’s piece had me thinking about Proctor’s neighbors who have gone on to their final resting place at the Proctor Cemetery, Jane Kenyon and Donald Hall. As some of you may know, the famous poet and writer power couple lived around the corner from Proctor at Eagle Pond. A number of folks are working to bring attention to their work, art, and lives as poets and people who lived full and passionate lives in Northern New England where we Proctor folk make our home. Hall’s wonderful poetic prose piece to Kenyon stands the test of time. Read “The Third Thing”: HERE. \nAlso, come celebrate Donald Hall and Jane Kenyon’s work at Proctor in two weeks. Stay tuned for more details on our portal of events.",

  "text": "Nov 30 2023 9:06 AM \nAs a coach, momentum is either your best friend or your worst enemy. If your team is making a run, you hear fans cheering, watch as your players dial in their focus with adrenaline rushing, and maybe even a flow state achieved. If your team is on the unfortunate end of momentum, you hope for the whistle to blow, searching for any stoppage of play to call a timeout and help your team regroup. \nRegardless of how your team was playing heading into the timeout, great coaches help their teams emerge focused and resolute in their determination to either rebuild the momentum they had prior or to alter their team’s course moving forward. This week, we returned to action after a well-deserved timeout over Thanksgiving Break and have seen our community capitalize on the momentum from the Fall Term, carrying it forward into the winter months. \nWinter sports teams are on snow at the Proctor Ski Area and our varsity basketball teams hosted St. Paul’s School Wednesday afternoon for opening scrimmages. The energy in the gym was palpable, as it is over at the ski area each afternoon. While early season results are rarely indicative of the direction a season will take, there is optimism that accompanies a new season as we appreciate new talent, new roles we get to play, and come to the realization that we are joined together in a shared mission for the next twelve weeks. \nThe same energy and enthusiasm we saw in the gym yesterday is mirrored in the first days of classes and auditions for the winter musical, Mean Girls the Musical, High School Edition, as the Performing Arts Department hosted Michael Stoddard, an Executive Director, Artistic Director, Actor, and Playwright, for a master class in auditions. We are riding the momentum that comes with a new beginning and a fresh start, but as seasoned educators we know there are always plenty of highs and lows for our students over the course of the winter months. \nIt is during these moments when we may feel a shift in momentum that Proctor’s educational model shines most brightly. Some schools (and families attending those schools) trend toward a transactional approach to education where there is merely an exchange of goods and services and a pre-articulated “outcome” for tuition dollars. At Proctor, we engage in a vastly different approach to our work. We invest time and energy in our students so we can listen deeply to them as they shape their own Proctor experience. We view each sport, each course, each performance, each success, and each misstep as a piece of their journey of becoming. The only transaction that occurs is our families placing their trust in the gifted educators across the Proctor community. \nIn the hectic, unpredictable, highly emotional “game” of adolescence, we feel confident, as parents, when our children are surrounded by a “coach” -- regardless of whether that individual is serving as an athletic coach, an advisor, a dorm parent, a teacher, or a director -- who we know will aptly call a timeout when they feel a shift in momentum in our children’s lives. It is this partnership between educators, parents, and students that not only allows us to do our best work at Proctor, but allows us to see the most remarkable growth in our students. Here’s to a great Winter Term ahead. \nFollow Daily Life at Proctor on Instagram!",

At Proctor, we engage in a vastly different approach to our work. We invest time and energy in our students so we can listen deeply to them as they shape their own Proctor experience. We view each sport, each course, each performance, each success, and each misstep as a piece of their journey of becoming. The only transaction that occurs is our families placing their trust in the gifted educators across the Proctor community. \n\n![Proctor Academy Community](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_4/v1701353100/proctoracademyorg/okaly5bmai0qqrx1js0y/235A9811.jpg)\n\nIn the hectic, unpredictable, highly emotional “game” of adolescence, we feel confident, as parents, when our children are surrounded by a “coach” -- regardless of whether that individual is serving as an athletic coach, an advisor, a dorm parent, a teacher, or a director -- who we know will aptly call a timeout when they feel a shift in momentum in our children’s lives. It is this partnership between educators, parents, and students that not only allows us to do our best work at Proctor, but allows us to see the most remarkable growth in our students. Here’s to a great Winter Term ahead. \n\n## [Follow Daily Life at Proctor on Instagram!](https://www.instagram.com/proctoracademy/)"

  "text": "Every community has a superpower. One of Proctor’s happens to be the act of showing up for each other with our whole selves. We tell our students (and our own children) ad nauseam that 90% of success in life is simply showing up, but in reality it is about more than simply showing up. It is showing up FOR others -- in the small moments, in the really hard moments, and in the moments of pure joy. When we show up for each other time after time, we build predictable trust that sits at the heart of an interwoven community. \nDuring these final weeks of the term, we get to see our super power in all its glory. Starting with last weekend’s performance of “Lost Girl”, and then punctuated by Ocean Classroom’s Symposium Thursday evening, our final football game of the season on Friday evening, Board of Trustee Meetings, and a full slate of games and competitions on Proctor/Holderness Day on Saturday. On Monday evening, the Fall Term Art Show, Vocal, Instrumental, and Dance Ensembles will perform, and on Tuesday we will host Innovation Night showcasing culminating academic work from across a variety of classes. \nDuring stretches like this, it feels nearly impossible to be at every event, but this is what vibrant communities do for each other. By providing seemingly endless opportunities to see our students in action, we reinforce the belief that it is through living that we do our best learning, and it is through showing up for each other that we learn the deep, intrinsic benefits of living in community with others. \nAs we donned our green and white on the sidelines of games and in the seats of the theater, we witnessed students stepping boldly into the proverbial arena that Teddy Roosevelt referenced in his speech delivered on April 23, 1910 in Paris: “It is not the critic who counts; not the [person] who points out how the strong [person] stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the [person] who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends [themselves] in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if [they] fail, at least fails while daring greatly, so that [their] place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”\nIt is not easy playing and performing in front of your peers, but it is in these moments, when sidelines are packed with friends, teachers, parents, families, and classmates that we see the web of support behind each of our students. JV Field Hockey (4-0 win) and Mountain Biking (a defeat on Holderness’ home trails) kicked off our day of competitions at Holderness on Saturday, followed soon after by Girls Varsity Soccer (0-1 loss), Boys JV2 Soccer (1-0 win), Boys JV1 Soccer (1-0 win), and Girls JV Soccer (0-0 tie). With victory within reach, Varsity Field Hockey battled to a 1-1 tie after a late Holderness goal, setting up the day’s finale (Boys Varsity Soccer) as a winner-takes-all event as our two schools were knotted up at 4.5 points a piece. After Holderness drew first blood, the boys rallied for the comeback win leading to the whole school charging the field to celebrate our third straight Proctor/Holderness Day win. \nAs students hoisted The Granite into the air, we, as adults, stood back watching the joy, pride, camaraderie, and sense of accomplishment on their faces. It was hard not to smile at the way these kids, and this community, showed up for each other. This is what end of term art performances and Holderness Day are all about: boldly sharing our hearts and passions and souls with the world. In life, it is easy to avoid the arena, to stay on the sidelines, to avoid risking the emotional vulnerability that lives hand in hand with performing. But this is not where we live our best lives. We live our best lives when we step into the arena, onto the stage, in front of our peers. We experience living when we spend ourselves in a worthy cause and allow ourselves to feel all the emotions we are capable of feeling, alongside and supported by our friends. May we keep showing up for each other as we wind down the term. \nCheck out photos from Proctor/Holderness Day 2023 Here!",
